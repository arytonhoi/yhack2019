From my experience the captains are usually very pleasant if there‚Äôs turbulence they get on the speaker to try to make you comfortable and for some reason (and maybe it‚Äôs a coincidence) but i‚Äôve experienced less turbulence on JetBlue than any other airline. But man you people got to get it together. It‚Äôs become common place for you to push back your flights my 75-year-old mother was waiting in the airport for four hours for a flight because you kept pushing it back.

    {"source":"facebook","username":"Eva Avleeva","date":"Jul 20","content":"I have used JetBlue airlines twice in the past two months and have had a terrible experience both times. With the first flight, my flight from Orlando to New-York got delayed a couple times. Therefore, I did not make it the next flight from New-York to Moscow. When I asked if they would assist me with a hotel since they caused me to miss my connecting flight, I got a response that the hotel that they have a contract with is full. I spent the next 17 hours in the airport. UNACCEPTABLE for a company that claims to take care of their customers. Now I am flying JetBlue again as part of my return trip and my terrible experience has continued. After the second flight from Moscow to Washington which was a 10+ hour flight, I have to spend another night at the airport BECAUSE OF JETBLUE. My final flight of the trip (the JetBlue flight) from Washington to Orlando has been delayed 9 times so far and I am still waiting!!! Like literally sitting here waiting for the last four hours... and the flight has been delayed again and is expected to leave 2 hours from now... as long as it doesn‚Äôt get delayed AGAIN. The customer service desk now says that they cannot do anything like provide a hotel or rebook unless the flight gets cancelled... AT WHAT POINT DOES THE FLIGHT GET CANCELLED? AT THIS POINT WE WILL BE TAKING OFF 6 HOURS AFTER IT WAS SCHEDULED... INTO THE NEXT DAY! HOW LONG WILL THE DELAYS CONTINUE... UNTIL WE RUN INTO YOUR NEXT SCHEDULED FLIGHT TOMORROW? I still cannot get a hotel so I guess I will have to spend another night at the airport. I have flown quite extensively both within the US and internationally. This is my first experience using JetBlue as part of this most recent round trip. I will seriously have to consider before booking JetBlue as part of any of my flights. This has been a terrible experience and a terrible first impression!!"},
    {"source":"facebook","username":"Felisha Ali","date":"Apr 8","content":"Flight 1818 departed Port of Spain, Trinidad on Sunday April 7th at 341pm. It was supposed to be a nonstop flight arriving at JFK at 910 pm. At the gate in POS we were told the plane would need to make a stop in Fort Lauderdale for fuel. This caused a lot of confusion and concern for passengers- why did the plane not have enough fuel? Why were we flying on a plane that was not properly fueled? We boarded the plane and the pilot informed us that the plane was due for some maintenance and today was the expiration date for required maintanence. He also stated that the parts were not available in NY which is why the plane needed to go to FLL. This caused a lot of concern for passengers as to why Jetblue did not complete required maintanence prior to the expiration and why we were flying a plane that was not in the appropriate condition. Passengers were worried and confused especially given recent plane crashes. We made it to FLL around 820PM and went through customs, had to recheck our bags and get new boarding passes. Our boarding passes said the flight would leave at 1130 PM. There was no gate number on the tickets and the airport boards displayed an 845 departure time. Upon arriving at the gate we were told they were going to try to board earlier than the intended time. We finally boarded around 11pm and were ready for take off until the pilot once again informed us that there was an error showing up that needed to be checked. While we waited as the crew checked, we were told the plane had no food and they were not allowed to serve any beverages besides water. They said all the food places in the terminal were closed. Around 1215am the plane finally left the gate but ended up sitting in place until around 1am when the pilot told us we needed to return to the gate and deplane bc of a mechanical issue. We are all now sitting at the gate in fort lauderdale. We cant step out bc tsa is closed and we wont be able to get back in. Our new departure time is estimated to be around 5 am while we wait for a new plane and flight crew. We cant get anything from our bags that were checked in. We asked for a hotel for the night but the attendants have informed us they are all booked. Many individuals have work in the morning and need to call out or start late because of this issue. How is Jetblue going to fix that? This situation is unacceptable. We are all extremely disappointed by jetblue and their communication and decision making during this situation. By not keeping your planes up to the appropriate standards you have caused distress for all of the passengers of flight 1818. We felt unsafe from the time we left port of Spain and reboarded the plane in FLL. I have always trusted jetblue and chosen them even when prices are higher. They have to reevaluate their priorities and put their customers first. I hope you will put customers first and handle any situations better in the future. How are you going to fix this?"},

I was told no, and what was supposed to be an 8 hour journey has turned into 24 hours of hopping through multiple connections. I'm now on one of my multiple connections. I decided to track my original flight and it landed early, which would have given them enough time to transfer my bags and me walk two gates down to my connecting flight! With my work schedule this year I haven't been to see my significant other for 6 months, and you're delaying that because you dont know when your planes will be able to land.

There is something called \"core\" seats that I am told do not cost additional money. However, there were no core seats available. But according to the chat agent, JetBlue does not oversell their flights; so a seat is available. As a result, I have to go to the gate agent to get a seat assignment at the airport. It appears to me, they do not pre-assign seats and through a message at check-in after one declines to buy a seat, that a seat is not guaranteed which appears to be a tactic to scare you into buying a seat.

The flight home, was a completely different experience. It's amazing how sour flight attendants can change the entire experience. The boarding process was wonderful, quick and painless. We took off on time with zero issue. The two flight attendants were horrible. They scowled, they rolled their eyes at requests (I watched one man hit the call button and ask for a drink, the attendant turned around, sighed, rolled her eyes, then went to get the drink..which he had ordered when the had the drink cart and forgot to bring him.) At one point I overheard one of the flight attendants complain that they were going to be shuttled to one of the major NY airport for a night flight after ours, apparently that's what put them in such a foul mood. It sucks, but it's also your job. There are often times I'm annoyed with things at work and I try my best not to make the world around me miserable as a result.\n\nBased on my first flight I would have said I'd exclusively fly JetBlue, but based on the second one, my opinion is \"meh\" to say the least."},

When the belt was closed our worse nightmare was squarely looking us in our eyes. How do we get these three children home with all of these suitcases with NO Stroller. We promptly went into the office and placed a claim. The agent opened up boxes and gave us a stroller to use although it was not a double. With much difficulty we managed to make it home, frazzled but in one piece. At home we completed the paperwork to receive reimbursement for this very expensive stroller.

Firstly, several customer service personnel at several counters said they could help with a baggage issue that occurred, only to find out later that they could not do what they promised, meaning we would possibly be late for a connecting flight. Then, Jetblue told us a flight was being cancelled because of a storm coming in, but it wasn't immediately cancelled as they outlined and we booked with another airline. Jetblue tried to not reimburse my money, then after four different calls, finally said they would give me a travel voucher and if it was cancelled they would reimburse. Once flight cancelled, as it did later happen, it was a hassle to get my refund. I waited seven weeks, four more calls and several promises later, I got my refund. I have never had such terrible customer service and such a poor experience with an airline."},

This experience makes me think twice about flying with Jetblue since its a major inconvenience and each passenger is allowed one carry on in overhead bin and a small bag under seat.

I had the flight with JetBlue on 16 August. When I reached Detroit, I didn't receive of one of my Suitcases (it had 23.5 kg weights). At the airport, I filled the form to track the status of my bag. From that time unitl now, every day I call them to ask the status of my bag. They hardly answered and always promised me to call back, but no one called me back. My staff inside my suitcase was so important and necessary for me. Always I said them but they never paid attention. I really spent the hard situation during this time. I was a new student here, didn't know anyone, didn't have car, and I was not familiar with Detroit. I lost my staff inside the bag and couldn't buy them. The weather suddenly became cold in Detroit and I didn't have warm cloths because they were inside my lost suitcase. I called them, talked about the situation, wanted them to find my bag or compensate their mistake. They really didn't pay attention. I lost my weight and became ill because of the cold weather. I was crying sometimes and really need their help, but they were really irresponsible people. After long time, they paid me only 650 $ for delay and wanted me to fill the form related to staff inside the bag with their price and details. I spent more than 10 hours to fill the form. The staff inside the form was really important and valuable for me. I really love them and I lost them. The expenses that I estimate in my form became more that 4000 $. But, two days ago they sent me message that we only want to pay you 250$ as compensation. JetBlue is really baaaaaaaaaaaaaaad airline. Not only they are not responsible for your suitcase and always you fear that they lost your sta, but also if they lost your staff, they never compensate it. Never try JetBlue."},

Wife and I going to a family wedding in Portland. So we awoke at 2.45am to check in at 4 am for a 6 am departure. Plane seats were doing and let space was quite comfortable as advertised. This was a pleasant surprise! Attendants were professionally pleasant and efficient. Arrived Ft. Lauderdale at 9.05 am. Connecting flight to JFK New York was at 2.54 pm! The long wait meant we were now awake for 12 hours. Flight to JFK was on different equipment and the seats weren't as comfortable as the plane was an older model. We reached New York around 6.25 pm and departed on our final leg at 8.20 pm. This was the longest flight but this Jetblue plane was identical to the first and we were both very happy for the comfortable seats, me in particular with my near 6'3\" frame. Staff were pleasant, the snacks and drinjs, while standard were a bit different, especially the blue corn chips! Kudos to the pilits. They got us there 20 minutes early! I think we had a strong tailwind or something. So we arrived but because the Portland airport wifi was woeful we could not summon an Uber. Instead of paying an estimated $28 we took a metered cab and it cost us $55. We had been up for twenty six hours by the time we entered our apartment in Downtown! Our return leg was via Boston and again it was a pleasant early flight lasting 5+ hours. To our immense relief Jetblue had scheduled our departure gate a mere two gates away from our arrival gate as our concern was the very short 1 1/4 hour connection time to Ft.Lauderdale. From Boston we returned to Florida in just over 3 hours, again on a comfortable Jetblue flight. With the exception of one of our six flight legs I found the seating comfortable and the staff professional, efficient and pleasant. I will definitely fly Jetblue again from Barbados!"},

If it wasn't for our service at the gate from Elijah on our return trip, the rating would have been lower. My husband and I did not have seats together when we checked in, we were about 10 rows apart. When we got to the gate, we approached Elijah to see if there was any way we could be moved closer to each other.

We waited about 15 or 20 minutes, and in the end the co-pilot himself was nice enough to call someone to help us, as the flight attendants seemed to take the attitude that it was *not their job* to do anything about getting a wheelchair.\n\nAnd all during the flight, the flight attendant in our section was not rude exactly, but she certainly was not polite, and neither was she friendly.

This particular flight was extremely turbulent for what I feel was an extended period of time, well over an hour probably closer to 2 hours. The flight was so turbulent that no one could use the bathrooms and there was no snack or drink service. I was flying with 2 small children and they were extremely scared. People around us were praying and clutching to their seats and many were sobbing. One thing I need to mention is that we were forced to fly separate as a family so I was sitting with my children but my husband was sitting separate, and not in view. I even paid more for extra legroom seats but still could not be seated together. I was told that typically passengers will move to accommodate families with young children and that I should check at the gate. When I inquired at the gate I was told there was no way to seat my family together and the Jetblue rep was rude about it. The flight was horrible whether or not we were seated together but I do believe that sitting together may have helped ease my children's worries even if only slightly. There was another young boy on our flight that had a severe panic attack due to the amount of turbulence. It was really a very bad flight and what was most frustrating was that the the pilot nor the flight attendants gave us any information as to what was happening, whether it was normal and how long we could expect the turbulence to continue. There were no updates or announcements whatsoever. Upon returning from my trip I called Jetblue to discuss this matter and I was told there was nothing that could be done. That if it was deemed a bad enough flight that I would hear from a Jetblue representative. That never happened. It was so bad that I am looking forward to driving vacations for as long as I can manage, because I do not want to fly again any time soon. I am just happy to be alive and well after that experience."},

I had booked a $250 one way ticket to Chicago for Saturday early morning with Jet Blue as I had a very important professional meeting, I had decided to go a long time ago. Arriving at the airport, the Jet Blue app (that was supposed to retrieve my boarding pass) was broken. When I tried to get help from their staff not only were they not helpful but they also told me it wasn‚Äôt their problem. I ended up missing my flight and the next available flight was 9 hours later. I ended up missing my meeting, spending the whole day at the airport, sitting in a chair. I called the customer service to at least get compensation back, and they had the audacity to tell me I wasn‚Äôt worth it. Then I sent out an email, explaining the extent of the problem, and in return I got back $50 credit for Jet Blue. At this time I was outraged. They thought they could get away with it with a credit that was less that 1/4 of the purchased ticket. I reached back again saying that I never asked for a gift card, and they‚Äôd better compensate me in a proper manner for everything I had to go through that day. I was then given another $25 credit for Jt Blue flight tickets. I said give it all to charity because I will not trust your company again to take me places. I don‚Äôt think should settle for this amount of money. It is ridiculous and insulting. My time is as important as theirs. They should have at least given me back the full amount of this flight, as the only reason I wanted to go chicago was for the meeting, and I missed it because of them. My flight back was with Delta Airlines. I had a very pleasant trip with no surprises or rude staffüôÇ"},

The entire process from filing the claim, to finding the bag again after 2 months (another passenger had taken by mistake), to getting the bag customs cleared by FedEX in India, to begging for approving the claim because the JetBlue Baggage Claim department is not able to provide the required commercial invoice and documents to FedEx. I have made 100s of calls to JetBlue keeping all my calm and patience. They never bother to call back and follow up. Sandra Cody (Sandy) and Luiz are two women who have no courtesy or customer service knowldege.

For the past few years, I have been very disappointed to say the least. Flight prices can be a bit higher than norm. My last few flights with JetBlue has been major pains and disappointments. Every single flights I have taken from January 2019 of this year has been delayed for the minimum 3 hours or more. My last flight out to Vegas was a disaster. I called ahead of time and asked if my flight was delayed. No! was the reply I received. Upon arrival and check-in all was well. I took one glance at the monitor the minute I cam through TSA and the flight was updated to DELAYED!! I said ok. But wait this is way to early in the morning to be delayed. Got to the gate, what was the reason I asked, Oh, we have mechanical issue. Better to have a working function plan than not I say to myself. Then another announcement, the flight as been delayed until further announcement. Flight didn't pass inspection. OK, my response to her was, didn't they not know about this flight going out. Of course she misspoke, well the pilot is not here as of yet. But yet we have mechanical issues and there was not plane to begin with. We waited almost 4 hours to get on a flight only to be told, we are changing your gate and waiting for the arrival of another flight to come in. DISSAPPOINTED AND ACCEPTABLE!!

That said, forget about their website. It's the most frustrating process of their experience. It is sluggish and rarely, does it work efficiently. It doesn't stay logged on, and when checking MY TRIPS, it makes you log on again. I've often gotten all the way up to paying for my flight, and when I hit PAY FOR FLIGHT, I receive an error message.

It was the best. The plane itself was great, the inside was amazing and I felt like I was in a luxury top dollar airplane. I had a tv that I could watch basically anything I wanted, I could turn on 3D or 4D navigation to see the location and information about my flight, free WiFi, along with all kinds of charging ports, TONS of legroom, super comfortable seats that reclined, the head rests all have this adjustable pillow thing to cradle your head so if you fall asleep your neck won‚Äôt break off from slouching, and the staff was spectacular. I have to pinpoint and recognize one very special team member, Brandon, for making this trip so exceptional. He treated us with such kindness, and spoiled me during the flight. This flight just happened to be my birthday. My boyfriend had told him and he announced it to the entire airplane, I felt so special. He made sure that we were comfortable, taken care of and wasn‚Äôt afraid to have friendly conversation.

I was told they would not provide any hotel or meal vouchers and of course there is no way we can get you on another airline to get home because we don't partner with other airlines. I was also told I might have more luck at the counter at the airport - which is where I was about to be. The lady at the counter told me the same thing. NO HELP. I was literally stranded. I had to purchase a separate one-way ticket on Alaska airline to get home, and spend the night in the airport. That was another $500 and JetBlue would only reimburse me $50 - the kicker was that I had just purchased an upgraded seat for $40 and I didn't get any of that back. I wondered about people who don't have another $500 for a ticket, or money for a hotel room or food for 2 more days! How can an airline legally do this?

After seeing mixed answers we decided the best way to get the answer was to call JetBlue, the representative did not know the answer. Told us to call customs/immigration, they didn‚Äôt know either. So, we went to the airport before hand to speak to someone from JetBlue to clear things up and take the necessary measures to make our vacation go smoothly, we were assured he was going to get into the country and the only thing we had to do was check in at the counter instead of the kiosk. We boarded the plane, landed in SXM, only to find out that he did in fact need a visa to gain entry to the island. Customs there said that JetBlue should have known this and not let him on the flight without proper documentation, that they can get fined for this as well. So as soon as we got to SXM, they made us board the same plane and go back to FLL. We now lost out on our vacation, after spending all the money and airfare and accommodations and I took my only vacation week for the year from work. Trying to move past this, and make things right, I called JetBlue but the representative and their supervisor said that it wasn‚Äôt their fault and regulations change all the time. Isn‚Äôt it their job to keep up with the new regulations? To have their staff trained and competent to handle these situations? I tried to make sure we were prepared and have the proper documents for entry but JetBlue told me we did! If they told me a visa was required I would have made the necessary changes to my travels. And now they are saying that it‚Äôs not their fault, and that they cannot give me a refund. Beyond me to believe that they can get fined for this but still tell me that it‚Äôs not their fault. Will not be using JetBlue or recommending it to anyone until they make this right. So disappointed by their lack of responsibility for their actions."},

Luckily we had a great time in Montego Bay, because the trip back was not as good. This aircraft had smaller seats, and my wife and I were seated next to a very large man who took up a portion of her seat and she could not even put the arm rest down. The flight attendant could have given him a seat with a vacant seat next to him. Overall we were pleased because this was a packaged deal through JetBlue.

We were able to get on the flight but only scattered all over the plane. When we arrived, my wife's luggage was not on the plane. we were told that there was a 'sorting' mishap and that the luggage would be on a plane at 7 PM and would be delivered to our AirBNB. we called at 11 PM to find out where it was only to be told that they don't deliver luggage after 10 PM and that we would need to wait until the next day. the luggage was finally delivered at 6 PM the next day. we were lucky that we were on our way home on the bus because we almost missed the delivery. they were supposed to call a few hours beforehand so that we could plan but they called only when they got to the house and we weren't there. JetBlue blames this on a 3rd party delivery service. However, it was Jet Blue who ruined the first 2 days of our trip.\nthe flight is ok if you can get the extra legroom seats. 2 problems: on a 6 hour flight that flies through lunchtime and there is no food served to non-1st class passengers. you can buy food that is VERY overpriced (captive audience) such as a tiny salad in a pint container for $12 or be satisfied with soda and chips from the snack area. also, there are not alot of new movies to watch to pass the time - on our flight, the headrest TV kept turning off and you had to start your movie over again.\noverall rating of 2 out of 5 is extremely generous."},

JetBlue partners do not treat you the same as JetBlue employees do. Our flight transfered in San Juan and we took a partner airline flight to the island of St Croix. Our luggage was left outside in the rain in San Juan. When we arrived in St Croix, everything inside our luggage was wet! What a way for us to start our 55th wedding anniversary vacation.

First of all if possible Mint is the absolute best way to fly. We purchase our tickets in November of the previous year. That is usually when the new schedule comes out for the following summer months. We have found the ticket prices do fluctuate so it is very important that you check in frequently. As far as the flight you really have to experience this whole experience. My wife never really liked to fly and the mint experience has changed that. A five plus hour flight feels alot shorter. It is so comfortable, great food and drink and the flight attendants are just fantastic. Prior to your flight always look at the menus at their website.

I chose JetBlue because they offered the earliest flight to Cancun. I thought I was lying down on the beach by noon. Nope! That didn‚Äôt happen! my plan got ruined because the flight was delayed multiple times. spanning almost 5 hours, while we were on the runway of the JFK, the captain announced that due to ‚Äòmechanical issues' we had to go back to the gate, then after they fixed the problem it got more delayed because of the crew time limits. To make this situation even worse, the entire crew members in the plane were very rude to the passengers.\nThe flight back to New York was even worse. They again had some similar issues, this time it was about missing screws on the plane. Nobody in the jet blue team knew how critical those missing screws were so we had to wait and wait (like for 6 hours) until technician in the US finally said it was ok to fly without them. Everyone was very reluctant to get on the plane after hearing they had some missing parts but we had no other choice. On the plane, everyone was so hungry but they didn‚Äôt stock anything to sell. We were all told that we would each receive some 'travel credits'. I thought I was getting at least half of what I paid which was $600, but they gave only $70 credit. I‚Äôll probably waste that credit as I don‚Äôt want to book on jet blue anymore after that horrible experience."},

When I called the airline, a considerate agent entered the ticket price in a travel bank‚Äîmeaning that we did not lose out on the fare. Using the funds was a simple matter.\n\nWhen we breezed through the airport and arrived at the gate, I needed to make a purchase before boarding. Since it was not our turn to board, I thought there would be plenty of time. However, the process went so smoothly that my husband was at the front of the line when I returned. As has been JetBlue‚Äôs policy, the airplane door was closed well before departure time. Aside from a few bumps, the flight was enjoyable and every member of the crew attentive.\n\nThe positive experience continued at our destination. Deplaning went as smoothly as did boarding, and the wait at baggage claim was minimal. We have another reason to consider JetBlue our airline of choice‚Äîand they fly to every destination on our list."},

Staff assured me I would make that flight, especially when it was announced that the flight to Bermuda was also postponed. 2 Hours delayed we eventually boarded in Boston. And there we sat on the apron on board for another hour. This time it appeared the water tank valve was broken. So we sat. And I knew I was going to miss my connecting flight. We eventually arrived in New York - four hours later than we were scheduled for. Toilets on board out of commission for entire flight. About 8 of us with connecting flights that were missed so we stood in a line for over an hour waiting. Eventually they booked us into hotels - 3 hours later. As if things couldn't get any worse, when I arrived at the airport the next morning staff told us they were about to cancel our Bermuda flight because only 80 seats were booked. Apparently not enough to justify a flight to Bermuda. But they swapped out planes (a smaller one was made available) and they got us all on board. After all this you would think jetBlue would offer to compensate me financially but nope, not a penny. I arrived home in Bermuda 12 hours after I was supposed too.

JetBlue doesn't have curbside check in at Newark, but once you get inside their staff is there to help you with the check in process. My wife and sister-in-law needed wheel chairs, along with several other people at the same time. The staff worked out getting the chairs for everybody and getting us thru security and down to the gate. They were most helpful, The gate staff got us seated and despite being cautioned by the pilot that we might experience turbulence as we passed by the hurricane, which was along the coast of the Carolinas at that time, we actually had a rather smooth flight. On board service was very good. Our arrival at Orlando went just as smoothly as our departure with help to retrieve our bags and get curbside, My total impression was that JetBlue is one airline that still values its customers.

Sadly, the flight we were originally scheduled to fly on ended up being cancelled due to weather, so we both had to stay overnight in lovely Newark. When my travelling partner spoke to a supervisor after the cancellation, she was told that the information regarding changing flights was incorrect and he didn't understand where the gate staff got her info from. Therefore, my traveling partner COULD HAVE changed flights without me doing so as well. In addition to this error, the gate staff also told us that our flight WOULD NOT be cancelled since the airplane was already at the airport....wrong!

While in mid flight, one of the passengers had a heart attack and can I just say how well trained Lisa & Carlos are along with the rest of the crew. While I was praying for this poor man‚Äôs well being, they were fast in identifying the problem, worked well as a team and their communication was on point. They stayed calm through all this and stabilized the patient. We seem to forget at times while complaining Paying higher prices on air flights, that these flights attendants have a hard job. Although our flight had to do an emergency landing to beautiful Bermuda, it was all worth it in order to save a life. üôèüèø At the end, we arrived a couple hours late to PR but nonetheless made our trip just a bit more interesting."},

We were stuck in the Bahamas for the hurricane all flights were cancelled except for our JetBlue flight kept delaying and delaying. All other flights told their people that theirs were cancelled so at least they can find alternatives in their jobs and their life on the other side just JetBlue decided that it won‚Äôt ‚Äú take the decision ‚Äú or tell the people that the flight had been cancelled until the last minute. When they told us that it‚Äôs been cancelled I showed them on my phone that they said it‚Äôs been delayed not canceled so they lie to people too! It‚Äôs been cancelled but u won‚Äôt tell the people because don‚Äôt want to give me hotel vouchers for example?!!! Then when I ask about the hotel vouchers because the very next flight it‚Äôs 3 nights after they tell us it‚Äôs up to the airport well , let me tell you how JetBlue and staff in the Bahamas rude to what extinct! They saw us 2 adults with 3 children trying to go back home and they know flights cancelled and the manager there was playing on his phone completely ignoring us until my husband told him sir we have been standing until u check for us for at least 20 minutes ! Yes he let us wait and ignored us then asked another guy on the computer for the first flight which was 4 days 3 nights after and he cared less he was not professional and a very bad image to the airport and to JetBlue. I called JetBlue and the customer service rep was loud to me and he was screaming at me then I asked to speak to a supervisor on the phone he said ‚Äú have a good day ma‚Äôam ‚Äúand he hung up on me! Is this the experience u give to your people? Also that supervisor at the airport he said no travel vouchers for weather conditions??!!!! Are those the people you let us deal with as Americans somewhere else instead of being in a trusted hands???? !! This is the worst experience for us as a family. And beyond our imagination to act like this in a national disaster and I‚Äôll post this everywhere I go and let people know about the true JetBlue"},

After ~20 minutes on their customer care hold, I was told that it is a technical issue and we they couldn't tell how long it will take. I asked to be placed on another flight, but their options didn't suit my plans. They refused to place me on a different carrier's airplane, and they only offered 15% of the fare as a refund (my flight was two-way and this was my return). I am a frequent flyer and my schedule is not flexible, so I ended up postponing my travel for 24 hours, and missing a work day (which costs $$). The representative didn't seem to care at all on the other hand.\n\nI have learnt over the past few months that most airlines in the US are very unreliable when it comes to scheduling; there is always a high potential of having my plans messed up because someone there didn't do their job. Airlines have to be held accountable for their mistakes, and they have to be better prepared for unforeseen changes (yes; like weather being unfavorable). Passengers having to spend a night in the airport or paying hundreds of dollars for a hotel because of flight cancellation should not be OK. The fares collected are not trivial, and a good part of it should be put forward as insurance to be used in such circumstances. Instead, airline representatives are trained to give an attitude, to cut the road on any reasonable passenger demands."},

They do board the back of the plane first, which is just common sense in my book, but the on board movies leave much to be desired. I tend to watch my movies on a plane, so am so happy to catch up with current ones...there were almost no new movies on JB; many documentaries, but that doesn't peak my interest. When we arrived back in NY, the line to get to customs was like a cattle herding...a winding staircase, packed to the gills, which would be a fire hazard in an emergency. Then the baggage retrieval was horrific...there were 3 planes on one belt, and it stopped when the bags filled up the belt...leaving us all to take suitcases off so it would restart!

The disappointing was how long the delay was, the flight was supposed to leave MCO (Orlando) at 8:40PM. The aircraft was not pulled out until 10:35PM, that is almost two hours. It was a failure of the schedulers who scheduled the same aircraft that was coming from CUN (Cancun) to MCO to continue on a flight to BOG (Bogota). The schedulers failed the company. A two hour delay is unacceptable. I am glad the cabin crew and the boarding crew were very apologetic and explained the situation to the passenger. Additionally the flight crew did an amazing landing, didn't feel it touch down at all, that in my criteria made up for the delay. Kudos to the pilots.

They claim the flight was cancelled due to weather but not ONE other flight that landed or took off in the window of mine had issues. One of their employees eventually admitted that the pilot said he couldn't land in the weather conditions. While the landing in SXM is complicated, if every other pilot was capable then it leads me to believe the pilot was at fault not the weather. To get out of paying accommodations and crediting them, the airline chose to claim weather. Initially trying to tell me that all or most flights were affected from SXM - this was something easily proven false when you check other airlines arrivals for that day. JetBlue still has done nothing to compensate other than a very small airline credit that did not cover my hotel and meal I had to buy because I couldn't go home. The staff at the airport kept telling me to check online for updates but there is no wifi in the airport and the cell service is spotty at best. When I asked how they said \"figure it out\" talk about RUDE and unhelpful. JetBlue can keep their crappy credit - there are other airlines that fly from SXM and I would rather pay more than be treated like this ever again."},

The entertainment in each seat provides Direct TV feeds and many other features to kill time as well. However, the entertainment controller on the arm rest is placed on the spot where you usually put your elbow so the elbow frequently changes the setting unintentionally. The best feature I like is the free WiFi. I could text while I was flying. They also provide free snack and drink but you have to purchase other meals and alcohol.

We were about to roll our of the gate and the captain said there was an issue with a food tray or cart, the ground crew had to come on board to fix it. This took maybe 45 minutes.\n\n2. Once fixed we rolled out from the gate right into plane traffic. The pilot said we missed our slot for the runway and would have to wait for a new one. We waited for about an hour and the pilot came on saying we had a slot for the runway...BUT because of weather we would taking a longer Western route and needed more gas, back to the gate.\n\n3. We got back to the gate and gassed up, this took about another hour.\n\n4. We rolled away from the gate ready to conquer the world. We drove for for a while, seemingly just circling the airport for the views. This took about 30 minutes.\n5. The captain comes on saying he cant get a slot on the runway so we are returning to the gate...for the third time and people can deplane for snacks outside the gate back in the terminal. They were told that had 30 minutes and had be back on the plane. The lady next to me had a daughter who got off and she was messaging her mother saying there were not aloud back on the flight yet. This took about an hour and a half. I later over head the flight crew saying that the reason we went back was because the pilots on board for the return flight from Montego Bay had hit their limit for the day and had to be replaced. So if your following along while we boarded just before noon its now about 4:15ish.\n\n6. We roll away from the gate and get back inline for the runway. At this point the pilot comes on and says that because its late our flight would probably hit the night and one of our night running lights is out, SO we head back to the gate. This is roughly another 30 minutes down.\n\n7. Back at the gate the flight crew comes back on the plane to fix the light. This takes another hour or so.\n\nIts at this time the flight crew finally decides to hand out some snacks on the plane. Mind you they still have not giving out headphones for the entertainment system.\n\n8. Its roughly quarter to six in the afternoon, everyone on the plane is getting feisty. We finally leave the gate and get back inline for the runway. We drive and circle and run the engines up several times. We do this for a while, about an hour.\n\n9. Then we start driving and several of us on the plane note that it looks like we are driving right back to our gate. The captain comes on and says one of the passengers is having a panic attack and needs to be deplaned. A lot of yelling ensues. We wait at the gate while cops come on the plane and escort this guy off. I am not surprised he had a panic attack, we was stuck on a plane for 7 hours with no food.\n\n10. At this point the captain tells us to deplane because they have to get the luggage off the plane for the family of the panic attack guy and this could take a couple minutes. Its now roughly 7pm.\n\n11. Unbeknownst to us we are deplaning into a packed gate of very unhappy travelers to Oregon because suddenly their plane is not there, but a plane of VERY UNHAPPY passengers flooding out of the gate. Because I had been sitting at the back of the plane I was stuck in the loading tunnel for about 10 minutes while the people in the front of the plane started a screaming match with the gate people. This got people in the loading tunnel screaming about a fire hazard. Once the line got moving again I walked out to a gate that was packed to the gills with two unhappy groups of travelers and a quickly building police presence. By the end of it there were probably about 20 officers spread out around the gate with 7 or 8 keeping people away from the gate.\n\n12. Its about 7:30 now and no one knows whats going on. The cops dont know, the assorted JetBlue employees around the near gates have no idea. I go to the information booth at the center of the terminal. The lady there thought my flight had already landed in Montego Bay, funny that. She makes a bunch of calls and says that several more flight crew members hit their working limit for the day and we are waiting for new crew members, should be in on a flight around 8:15. I asked for a food voucher as I had been sitting hungry on a plane all day. She made some more calls and said snack boxes would be given out at the gate.\n\n13. Around 9:30 a new captain comes on the loud speak at the gate and says we are waiting for a few more crew members but the plane is in good working order and he expects to board soon.\n\n14. Around 10:30 we start boarding again. The same whole process as in the morning. This takes about 45 minutes.\n\n15. At 11:15-20 the captain comes back on and says that several people have decided not to continue trying to leave NY and we need to get all their bags out from the under carriage.\n\nWe finally take off around 12 midnight. Its worth noting their were a fair amount of children and some babies on the plane. My wife and I were giving away our snacks to the kids next to us because they were starving.\n\nToday, 7 days later as per the JetBlue bill or rights I called to get a credit for my flight, as per the rights both my wife and I are entitled to a credit of $250 each for being on the plane for over 6 hours.\nThe first lady I spoke to said sorry it was weather related, no credit, so I went in detail through all the events listed above and she said nope, still weather. I asked for a supervisor.\nThe supervisor came on and said its weather, so again I went through the events of the flight and she said there was a small mechanical issue that took ten minutes, otherwise its weather. She said she would be nice and give me a $50 voucher which I really didn't deserve because of weather. I told her that is ridiculous!\n\nI can fairly say I very well may never use this airline again."},

Be aware that the DirecTV and wifi stops working for the last 2 hours of the flight, once you leave US airspace.\n\nThe direct flight from JFK to Liberia is fast - just 4.5 hours - and the Liberia airport is very easy to exit and navigate.

It seems to have turned into a no-frills airline. You have to pay for everything onboard the plane (headphones Lunch, alcohol, etc). But that's not my main Beef. My main concern is safety. Namely, instead of giving the exit seat to a volunteer that is sufficiently fit to open the exit door in the event of an emergency, they sell (yes, sell) the seat for an additional fee. The seating in the emergency door seats should be based on willingness and ability to open the door when an emergency occurs.\n\nTIP - at Barbados Airport, do not bother going before the 2 hour check-in time.

Flight Attendants could really help out with this!!! It's not like de-planing in NYC passengers are hip to this and deplane quickly because other passengers may be needing a connecting flight, etc. It takes much too long to get off the plane and Flight Attendants could assist with this. Good Luck if you are in the back of the plane! And it used to be that you could de-plane in both the front and back of the aircraft.

So... that's the good news and really all that matters. I do like that the entertainment screen in in front of you so you don't have to down load an App and watch on your phone.\n\nThe bad part was that the chairs are not very comfortable and they only offered beverages once on a 5+ hour flight. The man stewardess (not sure what you call him) was kind pissy and bitchy. He seems put off when a passenger asked him for something or had a question. Seems to roll his eyes a lot. This didn't happen to me but I always watch to see how other people are treated and I was not impressed with his people skills.\n\nOverall I like JetBlue but they should step up their customer service. Maybe offer the blankets and ear bud for free and come thru with the little bottle of water so they don't have to drag that huge cart up and down the isle. I can see how that would be a pain you would only want to do it once per flight."},

Can't tell if, or when will you fly with JetBlue lack of proper communication, the \"manager\" who would not give his name, decides to remove me from the flight bacause I dare to complain. On cancelled flight, I could not get on line as their website must have crashed, good luck getting on the phone... And I was stuck for 3 hours in line just to get another flight that was so delayed I could not make a connection. Remember old good times when airlines treated you with respect? NO MORE - you are just a cattle to them. When I managed to find a website to make a complaint, they downplayed employee power trip or their chronic inability to keep a schedule or give us heads up about delays and would not even provide me with a complaint number or the name of the employee.

Great service - the flight attendants are always fantastic. Great food (yes, this airplane food is actually good) with multiple options and the signature complimentary cocktail is awesome. They provide individual bottles of Dasani water. The individual pods with the slide doors and the fully reclining seats with massage feature are amazing as are the comforter and pillow (rows 2 & 4 are individual; in rows 1, 3 & 5 you will have someone sitting next to you but they do a good job of providing privacy with the partition and spacing). There is adequate practical in-seat storage for your electronics, etc. They even provide a travel toiletry bag on every Mint flight with good stuff in it. And they give you a to-go bag upon departure with a Milk cookie, drink and food. JetBlue Mint really makes you feel special. It is an undeniable step up from any other airline despite generally not costing more. And the Mosaic program seems very good. I only wish they flew to Newark instead of JFK, but it‚Äôs generally worth the inconvenience (longer commute to the city and worse airport). If you have an option between JetBlue and a different airline, pick JetBlue. No brainer."},

Lauderdale-Hollywood and the check in was smooth. Our flight departed on time. This is my first time flying JB. I was a little nervous due to reviews but this was by far one of my best flights. The plane was nice and clean. The flight itself is very smooth which is always a plus for me being that I don‚Äôt like to fly but I do it for convenience. The flight attendants seemed like they were in a hurry but that is to be expected on a 1 hour flight. They have to serve everyone in that small amount of time. I asked for some earplugs to plug into the TV, but they didn‚Äôt have any on the cart. So iPhone users, if you want to watch TV on JB, bring regular earplugs. Other than that I have fell in love with JB. While I‚Äôm Montego Bay, our flight was delayed twice due to the weather and FLL being closed because of Hurricane Dorian. After the second cancellation we were referred to the 3rd party that we booked through. JB took care of their customers that booked through them and not 3rd party which is to be expected. We flew back through AA, but I was upset that we couldn‚Äôt get JB. I will definitely be flying with them again!!!"},

Got to OHare and discovered another BOS flight leaving soon so I asked about changing and they made the change for me with no cost involved. We boarded, taxied....and there was a glitch so we returned to the gate and sat for about 90 min while it was resolved. Staff was friendly and helpful during the delay.

On the same holidays we also tried Delta and realized what a gap is between these two airlines while the price is very similar. Mint has fully flat seats, which on a flight over 6 hours makes a huge difference as you are able to properly sleep. The food is much better and there is plenty to choose from - you select 3 options out of 7 for the main menu plus two dishes for the dessert and one starter. Zinfandel was excellent and also the sparking (Roederer Napa) was very decent. Plus you also receive a goody bag with toothbrush, creams and socks etc which you normally get on transatlantic flights. Of course you have access to the real time TV and good selection of movies and the service is great. So I would say it is no brainer - if you can afford business class, I would only fly Jetblue Mint."},

Everything went flawlessly smooth. This trip was booked by my employer so I asked Dave if he would be kind enough to put me in an aisle seat. When I received my ticket, I was in an aisle seat in row 1. When I boarded the plane, I was amazed at the cleanliness of the plane and the size of the seats. I was greeted by Josh the flight attendant who was very pleasant and professional. We talked quite extensively when he wasn't taking care of passengers and Josh (who resides in Boca Raton) was extremely helpful with advice on places to eat and directions around Ft. Lauderdale where I would be staying. The trip was possibly one of the smoothest and best flights I have ever had and I have flown over two hundred thousand miles on over a dozen airlines. I could not find a single negative thing to say about JetBlue. I will fly JetBlue every opportunity I get from here on out. Thanks to Dave and Josh for making the trip so smooth."},

We fly JetBlue as often as we can. Boarding has consistently been fast and efficient. Staff are friendly if a bit harassed, but you expect that with so many to take care of (our flight was full). We checked two carry-ons at check-in and found them with no problems, waiting for us when we disembarked. We shall choose JetBlue in future if we possibly can."},

I called JB Vac and they had no explanation about the change, so I requested that it be moved back - in doing so, I realized, when I got to the airport 45 minutes later that the plane leaving Atlanta was delayed 6 hours and I would miss my connecting flight to Barbados - Very distressing - I called JB again and asked if they could move me to another carrier - they could not do it - I asked if I can cancel this part of the trip so I can get another flight thru another carrier. I got a small credit for the cancellation and called SW and was able to get a seat in a flight arriving early enough in Ft. Lauderdale - the overall additional cost was about $100 - I was very disappointed with JetBlue. However, I am now well aware that I can cancel a part of a flight on the vacation and change it if necessary - if I had known this early on, I would have made some changes in my return from Barbados since I had an event in Orlando FL the day after my arrival home.

We paid extra for more legroom which would've been nice except they plopped a family including two screaming kids into our row. They were flying standby and said they didn't pay extra for the seats. I then tried to upgrade to business class as I had some work to do and there were lots of open seats, but the cost was more than my already upgraded ticket. (!) Happy to pay more, but not that much. Seemed wrong especially given the people next to us only paid coach, but all JetBlue said was too bad. So, not sure it's worth it to pay for more legroom. Instead, maybe it makes more sense to book late and you'll get that seat anyway? I am sure they will reply with some pat answer about how everyone has to pay for an upgrade but don't believe it!"},

My past few trips have seen me almost miss an event due to not having a gate on landing for over an hour. Almost taking off, then not due to some kind of security emergency and then having horrible communication and delays from JetBlue at the gate as the Palm Beach bomb squad came through into the wee hours of the morning. ‚ÄúDynamic‚Äù pricing changes that change when the person is on the phone and going through JetBlue‚Äôs internal system, and then not honoring the pricing they JUST told you.

Let me start by saying, my flight was scheduled to leave JFK on Aug. 24th at 7:04am, the flight was delayed three times, I had to wait in the airport for more than three hours before boarding with my two children. They provided us with chips and a small drink, what a slap on the face! They did not explain why they had to delay the flight 3 times, no explanation at all, so unprofessional! Of course my two children were very tired from the wait, eat breakfast around 9:30am, so I had to buy them breakfast in the airport, and we all know how expensive they are. I don‚Äôt care spending the money for my children but I think that jet blue should had provided a voucher since this was they‚Äôre doing, not ours, nope, instead they provide a small bag of CHIPS & a small Drink, what a disgrace! So fine! We dealt with it. Now, leaving back from NC to NYC at 8pm, flight was delayed twice, now I‚Äôm really frustrated! The final update was that flight was to leave at 9:15 pm. I went to check in my bag at 7:15 pm, the lady in the counter said, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre already closed, we‚Äôre not checking in anymore bags for that flight‚Äù, I‚Äôm usually a very calm person, but the attitude and the behavior this lady had towards me was unacceptable, especially when I‚Äôm not at fault. Then she proceeded to say that the flight was leaving now at its original time, this company has no consideration/ethic/class, I‚Äôm guessing that management has changed, please do not travel through this airline, they will make your life a living hell!\n\nThat‚Äôs not all! I asked her if I could leave my bag there and have my daughter pick it up since she was outside and I didn‚Äôt wish to miss my flight, after all the effort of making me more upset and making me waste time she agreed. I got at the terminal by 8:45pm, the way plain was still there, they didn‚Äôt let me board the plain, no final announcements were made as other airlines do, nothing! I asked to speak to manager, the manager was right in front of me but the clerk said, he‚Äôs not here right now. I continued to ask for manager, I had no clue the person next to the clerk was the manager since he had told me he wasn‚Äôt there. When the manager noticed I was not leaving till I spoke to manager he stepped forward and said ‚Äúlm the manager, how can I help you‚Äù? Who knows he was probably a crew member making believe he was the manager, had no ID, I asked his name he said Roberto, refused to give me his last name nor show his ID, while this is all going on, plain was still there. ‚ÄúManager‚Äù was no help at all! He said he will reimburse me so I can take another flight, I replied is a holiday weekend, flights are extremely expensive, will JetBlue match the difference, he said, ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt do that‚Äù. He wouldn‚Äôt let me get in the plain, wouldn‚Äôt send me on the next flight going out, no accommodations whatsoever! It was useless speaking to the ‚ÄúManager‚Äù. The only thing they offered was to put me in a flight today at 4pm that arrives to Boston at 6pm, wait for connecting flight that leaves at 10pm, No other options were given, is either what they say or you just can walk away is the attitude I got from management. Now, I‚Äôm stuck in NC, did not offer any vouchers, hotel, transportation, nothing at all! My journey is not done, let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs going to be my experience todayüò©"},

We switched our departure flight to NY from Tampa in an effort to avoid Hurricane Dorian. Our original flight was August 31st, but with the impending storm, we felt it was cutting it too close so we sought to leave sooner. Upon arriving to the airport we find out that the Chase booking agent erroneously and nonsensically switched the departure date to September 30th instead of August 30th. So now we are left without flights, Florida is in a state of emergency and with everyone trying to get out we are told that we could possibly be Stuck up to a week - depending on how the storm affects travel. We try every other airline in the Tampa International Airport, including flying out to all airports in and near NY. No luck. Even though some of the flight prices are exceeding $1000 for a normally $300 flight - all flights are taken for days and it is anticipated that travel will cease soon. Hector and Melissa of Jet Blue see our desperation and try to arrange a flight for us out of another Florida airport the next day, which would go to a nearby NY airport. Not convenient, we have no place to stay and our car is located at a different airport in NY. However, it‚Äôs better than nothing so we contemplate taking our chances as there seems to be little hope. Feeling defeated, anxious, and uncertain about the near future, we are about to leave the airport when Hector personally reaches out and calls my cell phone to inform me of 2 seats that just came available for that night‚Äôs flight, and it‚Äôs to the NY airport where we need to be! Talk about Divine Intervention!!! Hector and Melissa are angels! They went out of the way and personally made sure that they helped us secure that flight. The airport was hectic, everyone was trying to get out. They easily could have opted to let it go and not bother following up, but they did, and because of them we are back in NY tonight with our family!!! Thank you Hector and Melissa! Thank you Jet Blue! G-d Bless you guys and praying you and your loved ones all stay safe during this crazy storm!\n\nWe will never forget this trip - and definitely never forget Hector and Melissa of Jet Blue inTampa!

Then also, most budget carriers skimp on costs by leasing smaller gate areas and do not provide an adequate number of seats for their customers waiting in the gate area (unlike other carriers) so it's likely you will have to stand unless you are lucky enough to get to the gate early enough to actually find a seat. Budget carriers, quite simply, are seldom \"budget\"."},

The first trip was wonderful, without problems but this August it was very unpleasant and JetBlue Vacations was quite difficult to deal with . When we realized the flight wasn't leaving Sunday night (never informed by JetBlue vacations) I spent hours on the phone, waiting, finally rearranging, to make up for a flight that didn't take off on Sunday night. We finally got a flight Monday morning (JetBlue vacations did arrange that but only after I called them-- they never told me of any problems) and arrived in early afternoon, missing 2/3s of a day and we had to pay for the first night to keep our room (or else we were told we would have no room). Along the way an apparently helpful JetBlue Vacations agent got us a new flight (and told us the seats) but I later discovered we had no seat albeit a very helpful Jet Blue Mosaic agent was able to get us seats -- but interestingly we couldn't get our boarding passes on our apps but the helpful JetBlue Mosaic agent was able to get us registered etc -- thank you JetBlue Mosaic, shame on you JetBlue Vacations. Note that after many complaints and calls, I got a sympathetic agent and I was reimbursed for the extra flight costs I encountered."},

During that boarding process we noticed a lady on the plane having a panic attack. A member of the crew was talking to her and she calmed down. She said she was on medication which she had now taken.\nAs boarding continued two JetBlue crew members approached the lady and told her she was being removed from the flight. I'm not sure if this was necessary as the lady had now calmed down and taken her medication, but what it then meant was that they also had to find and remove her baggage.\nThis caused a long delay which was made even longer as the plane now missed its take off slot.\nWe ended up sitting in the plane for nearly three hours before take off. During this time the staff were repeatedly telling people to sit down, there was no understanding from the staff that people had been sat for nearly three hours and some of them needed to use the toilet.\nMy wife noticed how cold the plane was initially, the air con was really chilling , interestingly one of the first things they did when we took off was see if we want to purchase a blanket. After that that the plane seemed to warm up.\nThey also were selling the cheap headphones, most airlines give those out complimentary.\nThis was a five hour flight, we ate in the terminal about 90 minutes before our departure time. We had no intention of purchasing food and eating on the plane. With the delay though that meant the time on the aircraft would now be getting up to around eight hours. We felt that due to the delay some of the food should have been complimentary rather than them still selling it , it seems they were profiting from the delay.\nAll in all we found this airline poor, the staff were unhelpful and unprofessional, and everything had a cheap second rate shoddy feel about it."},

First at all, never expect Jet Blue to be on time from Nassau, they are 99% of the time late! The lady at the desk DID NOT GIVE ME THE TRACKING NUMBER OF MY LUGGAGE, BIG MISTAKE, ALSO SHE DID NOT GIVE ME MY 2nd BOARDING PASS TO JFK NEW YORK WHICH WAS MY DIRECT CONNEXION, SECOND BIG MISTAKE! THE SERVICES IN NASSAU FOR JET BLUE IS A DISGRACE!\nCustomer must be very vigilant and make their job because they are not capable.\nTherefore because the flight of jet blue was late 1hour and 30 mn in Nassau (as usual)\nI missed my connexion from New York. From this point my nightmare began. I had to wait 3 hours in a queue to be directed on another flight. I paid a total of $1500 for the flight from nassau to Doha with a stop in JFK New york. I paid to have the Qatar airways services, but at the end I was flying on Aeroflot, which doesn't offer at all the same standards and services than Qatar. Alone in the Airport of JFK at midnight, I actually did take whatever they had for me to leave this awful and dirty airport. They found me a flight on Aeroflot, I had to pay an extra for my seat (exit seat) 80$ when i have already paid the same on Qatar. The shame!\n\nBut this is not the end of the nightmare, is only the beginning. When i arrived in Beiruth in lebanon my final destination, they announced me that they lost my luggage. They couldn‚Äôt not tell me where my luggage was, obviously because the lady at Nassau airport did not give me a tracking number on my luggage as any other flight company does!! I spent my week holidays without any of belongings, luckily, I had two clean underwear with me that I had to wash by hand the time to buy new ones. I was going to the wedding of my closest friend. This wedding was planned a year before and I purchased my tickets 6 months in advance. Unfortunately, I COULD NOT WEAR MY WEDDING DRESS THAT I SPENT 200$ FOR THIS SPECIAL MOMENT. The day of the wedding I had to spend three hours to fill up papers to search for my luggage at the beiruth airport, but I couldn‚Äôt not find it.

I hear it is always a tough choice between jetblue mint and delta one. Even though I love delta one's transcontinental I would have to choose jetblue. First off, and I know this is just a personal plus for me, they make the best mojitos (or whatever that signature drink is called) I have ever tasted. I'm not gonna go into detail about the things everyone already knows they have like the amazing amenity kits, the great in flight entertainment, or the always amazing food options. What I will say is that jetblue is always the way to go because whether you are flying by yourself or with someone you know there will always be a seating option for you. I traveled with 2 friends so one friend had a seat all to himself with his own door and i sat next to my other friend. JetBlue has a specific concierge for mint and mosaic passengers that is always amazing. And when you're by your baggage claim I have never once seen our bags not come out first. I can't wait for their routes to europe to open up so i can fly with them their too."},

I took ONLY one bag of 75 lbs and was charged an extra $150 anyway, in spite of the fact that it is more economical space-wise for the airline to house my one bag at 75 lbs than if I'd taken the two bags at 100 lbs total. They also charged me the $89 for the extra room both with the ticket and then again the day before the flight. They backed off on that charge after I called them but refused to budge on the extra $150. Although I had paid for the flexibility, to change the flight one day would have cost me an extra $250. So, in all, paying extra upfront for the flex fare is worthless--they will still take you for all they can. These are dishonest policies and purposely misleading advertising."},

I appreciate the planes, the service, the amount of legroom provided on even the basic seats, and I like the one class of service and the in-flight entertainment.\n\nI have always hoped Jet Blue would add a couple of healthier options to their snack offerings, such as a Kind or protein bar or an unsalted trail mix. I am still waiting, but clearly, this is not a huge deal. I can bring my own snacks. I am disappointed that they recently removed the small \"pod\" sized bottles of water from the beverage choices and replaced it with a cup of bottled water. I liked the ability to replace the cap, hence enabling me to drink it at my leisure during the flight.\n\nThe most attractive part of the Jet Blue experience is individual TVs with in-flight television, movies, and music. This system failed me on both legs of my last trip on the airline just last week. On the outbound flight, my TV was very static-filled and virtually impossible to view. Fortunately, the seat next to me was unoccupied so I watched from one seat over. It was not the most comfortable viewing situation, but it was better than nothing. I did not want to physically change seats as the person in the seat over from that one would not have been pleased losing the seat between us; neither would I have appreciated losing the extra space. On the return, my TV was stuck on one channel, the Jet Blue channel, so I had no ability to watch at all.\n\nI notified Jet Blue after the flights about my experience and the \"remedy\" was to put $15 for each of the two legs of transit in my Jet Blue bank. So now I have a whopping $30 of Jet Blue money. How that helps exactly, I am unsure. There really is no way for them to make it right, but an impersonal form email letter telling me the resolution surely was not the answer. At least an assurance that the TVs would be serviced, would have been welcomed. I would have given a 5-star customer service rating if not for this \"solution\" to the above TV issue.\n\nAs usual, the majority of the flight staff were pleasant and the flight was on-time and we arrived at our destinations safely, which is most important, of course. Jet Blue remains one of the best domestic airlines available."},

I hate having to ask for drinks, snacks etc because I feel like Oliver Twist begging for more porridge (though the ticket prices don't reflect this!!). Jetblue passes out snacks and drinks, as much as you want (!!!) and then puts everything in a fridge/cupboard in the center of the plane and invites all passengers to help themselves if they'd like another snack or beverage! It's about time an airline realizes that those of us in economy class would like to be treated like human beings as well!! One of the flight attendants, Don, let a little boy help him collect the trash because the child asked if he could. Don said \"of course!\". One passenger tipped this little boy $5 and he accidentally threw it in the trash bag but didn't realize that until he finished his job. Don went through the entire bag to find the $5 bill!!! Where were the surly, exhausted, rude and absent flight attendants?? Not on Jetblue! They were all so friendly and professional. Now that we're hooked, we will try to find Jetblue flights because the service was just so incredible. I do hope it's like this again, because for the first time since 9/11, I ENJOYED flying!!"},

I used to rave about them to anyone and everyone, due to their affordable prices and extra legroom. Over the last year, that has drastically changed. Jetblue and their consistent delays, have now become a common joke. It isn't \"if\" there will be a delay, it is \"when\". Airlines are expected to encounter delays from time to time, due to weather, or mechanical issues, which is entirely understandable. Jetblue however, has far exceeded the norm. There are clearly ongoing issues, that have not been corrected or addressed within their company, that now cause every single flight to have multiple delays. It is a waste of time and money to their customers. If you want to enjoy a seamless flight and not have hours and hours worth of delays, do NOT fly with Jetblue until they address and resolve their internal issues."},

My family and I boarded the 3rd bus and was taken to Brickell Bay Aruba, which is a horrible hotel. There was no way I was going to end my vacation staying there when we spent a week at the Hyatt Beach Resort & Casino. Unfortunately the Hyatt was completely booked so we ended up at the Hilton which Hyatt arranged for us. At check-in we noticed people from our flight there. We were so upset because they got the Hilton and we got some hole in the wall hotel. Anyways to make a long story short we stayed and ate dinner at the Hilton. The manager informed us to keep our receipts and JetBlue should reimburse you.When I called JetBlue a supervisor informed me that there is nothing she could do about it because we didn't stay where they placed us.

Two weeks before I am supposed to fly out for my best friends wedding, I check my travel via the JetBlue app. The flight showed it was still confirmed, and everything was fine, but then I went to look into my seat assignment and was shocked. The flight was CANCELLED. I never received an email telling me my flight was cancelled and NOWHERE on the app did it tell me it was cancelled until I had to dig for more information.\n\nAfter this I called JetBlue to understand how this happened since I did NOT make any changes to this booking and just wanted to see how this happened and re-book my travel. I called and spoke with Tiffany, and she told me she had no idea how this happened. And then went back and forth with her supervisor Michelle to see if they knew why my reservation was magically cancelled. After about 5 minutes on hold i was told that someone must have logged into my account and cancelled it. Which I did not believe because I never cancelled this flight.\n\nI was then told my Tiffany that they would be willing to re-book my flight at the original cost, which sounded okay at first. But I asked how this happened in the first place and what would have happened if I didn't call in today. They told me it was essentially not their fault at all and that I was essentially to blame. I asked if they could give me any sort of upgrade or make this up to me in any way, which Tiffany told me her supervisor would not allow. I asked to speak to her supervisor then.\n\nI spoke to Michelle, who took zero accountability for what had happened. I know she did not cancel my booking, but something happened and it was cancelled and she was unwilling to work with me at all. She was extremely rude to me and kept asking for my credit card number, and I refused to give it to her until I had some sort of apology, which she refused to do.\n\nI then told Michelle that I have flown over 100 flights in the past few years for work and have never received this type of treatment from any airline employee. She did not care. I then said that I have the option to fly with other airlines, and that I would never fly with JetBlue again. Once again, she did not care about that and told me she could do it at the same rate. I then finally advised her I would not be booking with JetBlue and will be going with a different airline. I then mentioned that I would write a review about this interaction and advise all my colleagues and peers to never fly with JetBlue.\n\nOverall, I have never been disregarded as a person like this before. And from a customer service standpoint this is unacceptable. I urge you all to be cautious when dealing with this company as they will never get my business and I encourage nobody else to deal with them in the future."},

You'll need to do better than call. We had to stop and buy a bathing suit, couple changes of clothes, summer foot wear, personal care things etc. Many phone calls and we find out it went to Bosco Bay or similar in CA. It will be in Boston in 2 days when my son arrives. Oh good. My sons stuff was packed in there too as he was coming right from a job. NOT! 3 hours of searching for it and nada. It supposedly went to MEXICO and came back to Boston via United and was in United's baggage claim. Nope. So, now my son has no clothing except what's on his back. Another stop to buy stuff for him to wear. More phone calls. Lots of BS and run around by the people on the phone. Finally, 6 DAYS LATER we get a call \"Come get your bag we have it\". WHAT!!! No way you get it to us. Ok, now we are in the hands of a delivery company that has a 1 star rating and does not care AT ALL about their service. They say they will delivery the bag between...3 am and 7 am on a Sunday. WHAT!!! Never have I heard of anything like that. We are on an island so we had to sit in a car in the parking lot waiting for the bag to be delivered. It did not come. They ended up getting a tracking number and found out the bag never even left Boston until after 9 am. It finally arrived at 1 pm! The delivery phone person was the rudest, non professional person we have ever dealt with. The suitcase was intact is the only good message of this saga. Moral of the story. Jet Blue looses baggage often and on direct flights. Jet Blue does not find the lost luggage quickly and does not keep track of it once found. Jet Blue does not hire reliable delivery companies to return the luggage that you paid for and they lost. As far as the flight was concerned. It was an over nighter and they had no complaints.

On top of that we had to go through customs all over again because they took us to a hotel until the next morning for the next available flight. Therefore, we had to go through the check in process over again. To say the least, this was a terrible experience. I am a frequent flyer and have never experience treatment like this. The flight was delayed the next morning. They could not give us a reason as to why the flight kept getting delayed. When we got to FT. Lauderdale, Florida, our flight was delayed there too. We made it to Atlanta at 1:15 Tuesday morning. I see being delayed a few hours but a day and some. And when was asked how we would be compensated, we were told $150 credit towards your next flight. My husband and I had to call out from work on Monday. So we missed a day of work, an extra day we had to may for a dog sitter and we had to pay to uber to get our car because shuttle service stops at 12:50.

They served a complementary beverage and offered snacks (regular sized bag of chips, pretzels, etc). This made the 2.5 hours go by quickly. Baggages came out fairly quick, so I was happy.

      {"source": "tripadvisor", "username":"Jonathan S wrote a review Aug 2019\n1 contribution1 helpful vote","categories":["Fort Lauderdale - New York City","Domestic","Economy"],"content":"I was flying from Fort Lauderdale(FLL) to NYC(JFK) on July 31st, 2019. The flight was scheduled to leave at 8:36 PM and arrive at JFK at roughly 11:36 PM. It was supposed to be a simple flight that I had made many times before. The morning of the flight, I checked the flight status and it said it was delayed to depart FLL at 11:10 PM and arrive at JFK at 2:07 AM. This was a big problem because I had a connecting international flight from another airline that was scheduled to leave JFK on-time at 2:30 AM. I was shocked and Jetblue website did not explain why it was delayed. I figured I would go to the airport early so I could get on another flight to NYC. After I arrived and waited in line for customer service, I talked to a Jetblue representative about the situation. He said he could get me and my family on another flight leaving to JFK at 8:30 PM that was delayed from 2:00 PM that afternoon. He claimed there were seats on it. However, he began to go on his phone for 20 minutes. Then, he seemed to make a call but never actually said a word. This continued for nearly 50 minutes because he finally broke the news to us that this flight was completely sold out and the next available flight was next morning. I don‚Äôt know when this flight was sold out or if it was sold out when he told us there were seats on it. I don‚Äôt know what he was doing on his phone for over an hour but I was frustrated as I could‚Äôve gone to another airline to but another ticket. However, it was too late and all flights to JFK that would have allowed me to catch my connecting flight were gone because I had wasted my time with Jetblue customer service which ended up doing nothing for me. I asked the representative why flights were being delayed and he said there were thunderstorms in NYC. I checked the departure screens afterwards and it seemed that only Jetblue flights were delayed. No other airlines were delayed. I also called my family in NYC and they said there was no inclement weather the entire day. I started to question Jetblue‚Äôs honesty and transparency. With no other choice, I had to go along with my original flight and figure out the situation when I arrived to JFK. At around 11 PM, the gate agent for Jetblue announced that the flight was going to be delayed for 30 more minutes because of weather. After 20 more minutes, he announced that the flight was going to be delayed until 12 AM because there was no pilot for the plane. Everyone waiting was frustrated. Finally, at a little over midnight, we were allowed to board the plane. Before taxing out, the pilot actually walked out to the aisle and said to us that he didn‚Äôt even know he was supposed to be working and that he was at home watching TV when he got a call. Does Jetblue not organize or plan which flights have pilots? Or do they just get a random pilot last minute before the flight was going to leave? I was shocked at his announcement. When we finally go to JFK at 2:45 AM, my connecting flight had already left. I talked to the customer service of that airline and they said they were able to rebook me on a different flight that left that afternoon if I was able to obtain confirmation of the delayed flight from Jetblue so it was determined it was something out of my control. So I waited at the customer service for Jetblue at JFK for them to open and was able to talk to another representative. I explained the situation and she said that she was unable to give me any confirmation of any sort of how my flight to JFK from FLL was delayed. I explained to her that it was requested from a different airline and she outright said they were lying because that is a ridiculous thing to ask. I was lost at words because it seemed as if the staff only chooses what to believe if it was convenient for them. Moments later, an employee who I assumed was the supervisor came out and told me to vacate the premises because I was causing a disruption. I never raised my voice and was being polite the entire time! He claimed I was making things up and there was nothing else he could do for me. I had to go back to the other airline and tell them what had happened. Their customer service ended up calling the Jetblue customer service and regarding the delayed flight. However, they were able to sort it out and get me on the next flight out of JFK to my next destination. The amount of unprofessionalism, dishonesty, disregard for customers, and downright rudeness I have experienced from Jetblue in less than 12 hours was insane. There is absolutely no transparency or accountability towards customers from this organization. I will never be flying them again."},

Myself, my fiance and our 2 kids (ages 5 and 3 mos) were scheduled to depart JFK for POS on 8/7 at 9:10pm. Initially this flight was delayed, however, around 10pm we were allowed to board. Almost everyone was settled in their seats when we were directed to deplane bc there was no pilot! For the next 4 hours, the flight continued to be delayed while we received updates that they were still in search of a pilot (ridiculous!). The flight was finally cancelled around 2am! At that time we were informed that we all (a full flight) needed to go to customer service to be re-booked. Customer service was understaffed (2 people for a line of about 100), so I called the 1-800 # while in line and was able to get my family booked on the next flight. However, while in line, we were informed that there would be no hotel or food vouchers given for the inconvenience, so my family (including a newborn) \"slept\" at JFK that night. The next flight was delayed also and all of these delays caused us to miss our connecting flight in Trinidad with Caribbean Airlines, so once we arrived there, we were placed on standby and didn't get to our final destination of Tobago until 2am Friday morning. We were supposed to arrive at the resort at 7am on Thursday morning! I will NEVER fly your airline again and will be sure to let everyone I know about my experience. Absolutely disgraceful JetBlue!"},

I understand this to a point but when they told us this on Thursday when we missed our connecting and that we couldn‚Äôt get on a flight until Saturday at 8:40pm it makes you a little angry. Yes I was on vacation but the reason we decided to come home when we did was so we could go back to work, what you normally do when you come back from spending all your money. So when we were told we would have to stay in Boston because they couldn‚Äôt figure out anything else for us when I asked about other places to fly to and options, there response is well if we fly you to Chicago can you find your own transportation home? Chicago to msp, um no, I was suggesting that you fly us to Chicago and get us in a connecting flight from Chicago to msp. They also wouldn‚Äôt pay for our hotel stay because ‚Äúthe original reason for missing your flight was because of weather‚Äù, the weather happened on Wednesday we flew on Thursday. The only reason they get two stars is because the lady we dealt was nice and ‚Äútried‚Äù her best, not sure she really tried. The next morning we decided to fly standby and when I asked the gate agent some questions her responses were straight rude. I am in the customer service agency and if I was rude like that to anyone I wouldn‚Äôt have a job. I was never rude to any of them because I understand they get cranky, bitchy people all the time but it‚Äôs different when you aren‚Äôt doing that to them and they are still rude back to you. I‚Äôd rather pay extra for a different company then fly with them again, because I‚Äôd most likely miss a flight again, with no bad weather, and they‚Äôd blame it on the weather.

No more. After boarding the flight and having us sit around for an hour or so they disembarked us and said there was a simple sensor that needed to be fixed. On an hourly basis they said the problem was going to be resolved. The 10:58 am flight finally took off at 8:30 pm. The level of either incompetence or of deception was extraordinary even in these days where poor performance is expected. It was as if the airline did not want us to cancel and switch to another airline irrespective of the inconvenience to the passenger. Everyone involved in this clear deception did so with a pleasant smile on their face which leads me to conclude the reason for the delay was incompetence rather than deception.\nWe finally decide to pay for a very expensive last minute ticket to an alternate airport that was closer to our destination. Now catch this. Even though a $250 payment was promised per the passenger bill of rights, since we were delayed over 8 hours, if you cancelled your reservation even at the last minute to get on an alternate flight you would lose the payment. So we got a new ticket but did not cancel the old ticket since the payment would exceed the ticket cost.\nWe have had several severe delays on JetBlue recently. The latest 8 hours to fix a sensor was the last straw. Clearly this is a severe management problem. Maintenance is not up to the challenge of flying the heck out of these planes and clearly the airport staff has not been taught how to value customers and treat them honestly.\nGoodby JetBlue you were a good friend but have lost your way."},

The flight was scheduled to leave Atlanta at 6:30 AM on Saturday morning. Given that we live out of state over 2 hours away, we decided to drive down on Friday and stay the night at a hotel to be able to be at the airport 3 hours before our international flight at 3:30 AM. At 8:30 PM I received an email that stated our flight was cancelled and JetBlue was looking into options. At 9:00 PM we received another email that required us to rebook, less than 10 hours before departure. After receiving the cancellation email just 6 hours before we were supposed to leave for the airport. I called JetBlue and was on hold for over 30 minutes of asking why the flight was cancelled (no response given), and how we were to get our money back, along with a $200 change fee we were charged to book the flight in the first place. The representative became frustrated and hung up on me. I called back (now an hour later) and had to wait on hold again for 30 more minutes. When I got a hold of the next representative, she informed me that all she could do was give me a voucher. I asked to speak with a supervisor, and he told me to email all this information to this email. At this point, it was close to 10:45 PM, and we had no choice but to book a new flight. Flights to Grand Cayman were now (hours before day of departure) over $1000/person (we paid $118/person originally). After numerous conversations and request for compensation, we‚Äôve received no help. The last thing I need is a travel voucher for an airline that I don't ever intend to fly again."},

Thankfully we checked our carry-ons at the gate because the overheads quickly were consumed.The icing on the cake were the dirty seats (literally can see the grime on the back of the chairs) and the entertainment monitor not working. When the attendant was informed, she told me to find an empty seat knowing the plane was full. Yes, I was to find an empty seat, not her, but me.

There was no one at the JetBlue desk to explain why our flight was delayed, even though the e-mail we received told us to go to the airport anyway. When the flight continued to be delayed, we realized we were going to miss our connection in Boston, traveling to Iceland. When someone finally appeared at the JetBlue desk, we were told not to worry, they would change our tickets to a later flight on Icelandic Air. The staffer said it would take some time as their computers were \"not compatible \" with Icelandic Air. We left Charlotte 2 hours late, and missed our original connecting flight in Boston. However, when we went to check in on the later flight, we found we were not on the passenger list for Icelandic Air. It was now almost midnight. We found the last two agents left at the JetBlue desk and had to insist they fix the problem. I think they were ready to go home and weren't very happy to have to untangle this problem, created in Charlotte. However, they eventually got us on the flight to Iceland. Thank heavens there were seats on the later flight!"},

Their service is awful. They cancelled my flight due to weather but the reality is that the weather was fine and the day before the inclement weather was just in a few states early evening. They cancelled my flight that it was supposed to departure at 9:31am and let me know less than hour and half before. I was already at the airport and they re-schedule the flight for 8:45pm. The other flight that was available at 12:45pm was over booked so I was not able to get in the flight until 8:45pm. I had to waited all that time and the operator( customer service) and counter ladies were not able to help me. Unfortunately, Jet Blue does not has contracts with other airplane companies so they can not help you to find a flight with another company. Really dissapointed. Never again will buy flights to Jet Blue unless the company re-organizes their logistics and get more airplanes for sitiatiosn like this.

I‚Äôve experienced both with JetBlue, and when things go wrong, they go very, very wrong.\n\nI was scheduled to fly from O‚ÄôHare to Provincetown through Boston on JetBlue. JetBlue seems to have only one permanent gate at ORD, and when JetBlue has more than one flight scheduled, they share gates with other airlines (in my case, Alaska). I reached the gate about 40 minutes before departure, and no one was at the gate. Signs in Terminal G show only American Airlines flights (?), so I could only see my gate number on the JetBlue app or through TripIt, which is when I found it had move from G2 to G4 (an Alaska gate). No one was staffing the gate, and it was barely lit, but at some point I heard a faint voice advising the flight would be delayed. About 30 minutes later another crew member said there was no update. Another 30 minutes passed, and boarding finally commenced. All the while JetBlue never updated flights stats on their website, which showed an anticipated EARLY arrival, even though it was boarding a full hour later than its departure time. Almost an hour later the doors finally closed, with little communication from the crew. Finally an explanation was provided: the AC wasn‚Äôt working, but they couldn‚Äôt figure out what was wrong. And after a remedy was found they had to refuel.\n\nOh, it gets worse. Much worse.\n\nFifteen minutes later, after we‚Äôve pulled away from the gate, Boston announces a ground hold. The PA system isn‚Äôt working, the TV screens keep scrolling promotions for upgrading to better seating (like a 1960s rabbit eared TV). The pilot decided to power down the engine and wait on the tarmac, and immediately it‚Äôs clear the AC was not going to keep up. People are panting, fanning themselves, and I hear the flight attendant telling the captain there‚Äôs a problem in the cabin, and based on the response the captain isn‚Äôt prepared to do anything about it.\n\nWe sit there for about 30 minutes, and eventually head back to the gate, which takes another 20 minutes. They ask us all to deplane and await further instructions, which don‚Äôt come for another 15 minutes. The flight is canceled, and we will be rebooked automatically, and we should wait until we receive email notifications.\n\nI asked about hotel accommodations, and the clueless gate agent said there would be none. His job, he said, was to staff the door. He didn‚Äôt have any other information.\n\nI went out to ticketing and pled my case. I said it may have been delayed by weather, technically, but the ground hold would not have happened if the mechanical had been managed more efficiently. A supervisor came out and said he understood my point of view and would do what he could, but he couldn‚Äôt make any promises. An hour later he said they were still trying to book a Springfield Suites. An hour. He literally said, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this for everyone.‚Äù Seriously. When doing the right thing is something that‚Äôs available only to the most vocal, you know you have a serious systemic problem. I gave up and made my own hotel reservation. He advised I should save receipts and work with customer care, but again, ‚Äúno promises.‚Äù\n\nAt any point any JetBlue staff could have taken an advocate‚Äôs approach to the situation. There was no empathy, no problem-solving, no sense of any responsibility, no need for more than the minimum communication (which is emblematic of JetBlue). Everyone seemed to be relying on someone else to figure out the problem, and no one one took any initiative to make it better. It was a loop of pass the buck and ‚Äúit‚Äôs not my job.‚Äù\n\nOther less savvy travelers let the JetBlue system determine their fates, and I heard at least two people say they were protected on flights TWO DAYS LATER. JetBlue does not participate in interline carrier agreements and would not protect anyone on any other airlines. On one level I understand, but on another it‚Äôs just reprehensible.\n\nI‚Äôve had many good flights on JetBlue, but they clearly have no internal training on how to deal with terrible situations like this one. The ticket agents didn‚Äôt even know the flight had been canceled (nothing had been updated in their systems). How messed up is that? They were told to tell everyone in line that they couldn‚Äôt assist them, and I could see these very decent people were completely perplexed by the morass of JetBlue."},

Let me start by saying, JetBlue, that you have some of the rudest staff I've met in a long time and might I add, ignorant?\nJetBlue cancelled a number of flights to Florida due to inclement weather or in my case, \"due to unforeseen events\" without really notifying anyone that the flight had been cancelled. The line for cancelled flights was horrendous, but that was only the tip of the iceberg.\nOne of the JetBlue managers, in his infinite wisdom, decided to break up one of the lines and yelled that \"you can either wait in line with 400 people or 200 people\" meaning the line I was in would be at the back end of the 200 people. He didn't even tell customers where this other imaginary line was. Meanwhile, other agents were trying to discourage customers to stay in line because they didn't want to give any vouchers for hotels or food.\nJetBlue transferred me to a flight out of Westchester County airport for the following day without even asking if it was acceptable as I was in JFK. Plus, they stuck me in a middle seat and I can't even it change it online without their charging $50 for an extra legroom seat which isn't what I wanted. I just wanted an aisle or window seat.\n\nWhen I approached a JetBlue customer service agent about the possibility of getting a voucher for the shuttle I needed to get to Westchester County and a hotel, she promptly walked away.\nOne of the transport people, while probably not a JetBlue employee, told me to take the AirTrain to Westchester County. Seriously? Souburbia argued with me stating \"Mama, you asked me about flights,\" which I did not! Nor was I her Mama.\n\nI've had to take a shuttle to Westchester County and stay at a hotel close to the airport for the possibility of getting on a non-stop flight to Fort Myers tomorrow!\n\nAre you going to compensate me JetBlue for the nearly $300 I'm spending on hotel, shuttle van and then another cab to the Westchester County airport? I think not!\n\nI won't fly JetBlue again and will tell others the same! Time to get your staff sorted out, JetBlue, and help them understand what true customer service is all about!! You've got a long way to go!!"},

With the popularity of bluetooth headphones these days, I recommend that you bring a corded headphone to utilize their movie/tv selections.\n\nThe only downside with JetBlue is their boarding procedure. Being that I was traveling alone, booked my aisle seat months ago, I was still in boarding group E which is the very last group. Even though I checked in 24 hours before my flight, there is no alternative to being in group E. This meant that I had to check my bag in at the gate because they were afraid that there would be no space in the overhead. After boarding, I noticed that there were still a lot of space.

Four hours of delay and we were not told. The attendants were rude, too. In the end I would never, never in my life recommend BlueJet to someone. The service, attitude of the crew, and efficiency of JetBlue is horrible. Some mistake may have happened but to not be notified and to be responded rudely to is not acceptable. I hope JetBlue changes to a much better system in the future. Nothing is worse than JetBlue."},

We spent over $300. on specialty beef tips, chicken etc and froze it. When we arrived at the airport the checked baggage attendant asked if we had any meat or perishables to which we quickly replied yes. They told us due to a new policy, we could not check it in our luggage or carry it on the plane. It would have to be left in Boston.\nWe appealed to the supervisor who showed us on page 9 of the purchase agreement on the website, where the new rule was. Who gets to page 9?!? Then she said it was actually a TSA requirement but we checked with TSA who stated it was allowed by them. JetBlue also said that we couldn‚Äôt sign a waiver to relinquish rights to the condition of the food when we landed. So here we were at Logan Airport at 5AM, an hour and a half away from home with no way to get it there. $300+ of meat and a nice cooler bag lost.\nVery disappointed in JetBlue‚Äôs lack of communication of this new rule AND lack of appeal/waiver recourse!"},

How that is allowed to happen by a regional airline to handle foreign flights is beyond me. They changed my reservation twice without consulting me. The changes messed up my entire schedule and caused many complications. I had roaming enabled on my phone through Sprint (costs $0.25/minute), calls with JetBlue until they admitted that they made the changes totaled 3.5 hours ($52.50) and they still had the audacity to ask me for a \"penalty\" fee when I called to change my reservation to a much sooner date.\n\nHow a small-time regional carrier is messing with international-traveler' schedules is beyond me.

If you are thinking about using his airline, DONT! They are terrible. My husband and I purchased round trip tickets flying us to Cuba on July 13th, and we were to return to Charleston, SC on July 25th with a two hour a layover in Ft. Lauderdale. Before we left Cuba, our flight was delayed 3 hours. Once we got to Ft. Lauderdale, they changed our flight time 3 different times, then eventually cancelling the flight all together with no reasoning of why. We went to the JetBlue service counter to see what was going on. The woman working there looked at my husband who is a Cuban, scoffed at us and went on to tell us with a DISGUSTING attitude that our flight is cancelled and we can't get on another flight until July 27th. TWO DAYS LATER. I asked why and she said because that is all they will offer us. I asked here what she expects us to do until then and she said \"you will figure it out\" I asked to talk with her superior, who gave us the same response, then the superior above her came out and said they can fly us to New York the next day and then to Charleston. Not one time did they offer to put us in a hotel until they found us another flight. They actully refused to help us out at all. And they refused to give us any money back for the EXTREME inconvenience they caused us. LUCKILY American Airlines got us on a flight the next morning and took care of us and got my husband and I home safely. NOT JETBLUE. I will NEVERRRRR fly JetBlue again and I will do everything I can to spread the word of how horrible this airline is. They did nothing to try to make up for the inconvenience, we told them how my husband had work the next day and we MUST get home and to please help us try to figure something out, they refused. This airline is ROBBERY and RACIST.\nAfter we arrived home, a few days later a lady name Shauna from the executive offices called me to talk about the experience. I went on to tell her about how horrible the experience was, how nasty the employees treated us, and the $700.00 ticket we had to purchase from American Airlines just to get us home so my husband didn't lose his job. She said all she can say is sorry....sorry? HAHA keep your sorry Shauna how about make up for the cost and inconvenience your horrible airline caused. She said she can't do that. We asked to speak to her higher up, she said that is the CEO and he entrusts her to make al the decisions. She would not let us talk with him. So she made the DECISION to not help correct the issue. Then she got an attitude with my husband over the phone. Well Mr. CEO, if that is who you trust to make your deciions for you...BAD CHOICE BUDDY! She was just as horrible as the employees in the airport they had working for them. Maybe being a rude racist is the only people JetBlue employs! EVERYONE save yourself some misery and AVOID JetBlue, unless you want to get robbed, treated horribly and not delivered to your promised destination, then your at the right place!"},

Rather than being upfront about how long a delay would last, they gradually changed from a 6:30 PM departure to 7:45, 9:10, and finally 9:50. We finally got on the plane just before 10, but didn't take off until around 11:15. The pilot kept saying they expected to leave in 10-20 minutes and giving false excuses when all the while anyone on a flight tracker website could see it wouldn't take off until past 11.

At the gate JetBlue was asking for volunteers to 'gate check' carry-on luggage due to a full flight. I volunteered my bag.\n\nAccording to the JetBlue, the gate agent should have told me to remove all electronics from the bag before checking it at the end of the jetway. I was not told this, so I checked my bag with my iPad.\n\nUpon seating, I did see that there was space above my seat. But since I already gate checked my bag...the point was mute.\n\nOn arrival at JFK...my bag did not show up. I immediately went to the JetBlue baggage office and reported a missing bag. I showed them my baggage claim check and they processed the claim.\n\nThe first five days from JetBlue I got the same message. 'We have not located your bag but we will let you know as soon as we find it\". After 5 days, you can file a claim and we will consider the bag lost after 30 days.\n\nOn the third day, I got the usual call. But this time I made a request to redirect the bag to my home since I was leaving early. The JetBlue rep said \"call us in the morning when you have left NYC\". Seriously..you're on the phone now and if you found the bag I don't want it heading here when I'm heading to the airport. Then I told her \"OK I'VE LEFT\". Then she said \"ok I'll make believe you left and redirect your bag\". Like she was doing me a favor....wow unbelievable\n\nThey expected me to have a receipt for the items in my bag. Oh wow...I always itemize everything in my suitcase and have a receipt before I go on vacation...SERIOUSLY NO\n\nWell...its been over 30 days, but along the way these are the things that happened:\n- They said electronics will not be covered...WHY??? Nobody told me to remove them!\n- They will only pay a portion of the value...WHY??? I can't replace my items for a portion of the price!\n- I got a call from a JetBlue rep to handle my case started the process then stopped returning my calls and/or electronic communications.\n- Nobody the JetBlue can tell me what will be paid...WHY??? I was told you will know when the process is over...REALLY? What does that mean\n- JetBlue rep said \"the rules are set by Federal Rules\"...REALLY, Those are minimums not what you should do. IT IS NOT AGAINST THE LAW TO DO MORE THAN MINIMUM!\n\n...now waiting on JetBlue."},

Sorry, I‚Äôve never been on a plane where they go up and down the aisle hawking their different wares at different times. Every other airline I‚Äôve flown has 1 cart with everything and you don‚Äôt have to wait for the ‚Äúdoorbuster‚Äù announcements. Anyway, it was clear none of the attendants wanted to be there.\nTHEN on the flight home, 494 on 7/18/19, the DENVER airport (DIA) jetBlue employees were lovely and friendly and ready to help with a smile but then again, step on the plane & that Boston-based rudeness kicked in again. The stewardess who served my drink actually shook her head at me because I apparently took too long with my apple pay because she held the reader too far away from me and angled away from me and I ended up having to pull it to me and then needed to unlock it with my face which p'd her off causing the incredibly rude SMH moment. Unbelievable.\nThe seats were comfortable though and for that reason alone, we will fly jb again‚Ä¶and will know ahead next time not to expect manners if were are flying from Logan.

I just don't understand the hype anymore. Their E190s are completely trash: old, dirty and the TV quality is very poor. Same with their old A320s. The relatively new A321 also has not aged well. Yes, bigger screens but poor quality. Half the time, it's not working and when they are, I might as well use my graphing calculator because that has better graphics.\n\nThe staff at JFK is consistently and without a fault, rude. I understand, it's a mad house of a place any time of the day so maybe they're also stressed out. For a relatively new terminal, it has not aged well and it's just not a good place to be. The help desk that are supposed to be...well...helping people...are always under staffed.\n\nThe snacks and drinks are sub standard, for an airline who keeps bragging about their snack selection, it's really not that special.\n\nOnboard crew is mediocre. I've had better and more memorable service on United and American than JetBlue. The only redeeming quality is that their cockpit crew are often very friendly and chatty.\n\nBeing based on the East Coast, it's hard to avoid JetBlue. But how the mighty have fallen - on top of it, they have atrocious on-time performance and they always blame it on weather when there's not a cloud in the sky either at the origin, destination, or wherever the plane is coming from.\n\nBest part of JetBlue though?

In feburary, I went to Chicago and for some crazy reason, it took 2 hours to get from the runway to the thing where u walkout. what was so suspicious about it was that we could see many other gates that had no planes. I was told later by someone in the company that they only have a couple of gates in Chicago and instead of using another companies gate which they have to pay extra for they would rather us wait for two hours to use one of theirs. The impact was getting an 8-year-old home at 2 am and my good friend to wait over 2 hours for me and then work the next day.\n\nFast forward to last week and flying home from New York to Fort Lauderdale and to be clear about my upset, my daughter has had ankle surgery so I had to carry her on the plane and once aborad and it was completely full land we were leaving they tell us something has happened and we need to leave the plane immediately.\nI overhear the flight attendant tell his coworker that the driver of the fuel truck had hit the wing.\nAfter waiting 3 hours in the terminal we get on board again and now we are told the plane is safe, that the accident was very minor and it just broke a small plastic thing and it has been replaced. we are told we will be leaving shortly.\nMy daughter and I start to watch a movie. I notice we have not left...\nNext thing, we finish the movie and still have not left. We end up home almost 2 am again.\nThe only reason I give them a 2 star is that they did give a small credit to all the passengers. I wrote to them asking for more. I felt that the fact my ride had left, I had to pay for a taxi from the airport and that my car which was being fixed, while I was away, was not able to get and caused a second tazi in the morning and I missed a half-day of work.

The pilots did a wonderful job with both landings. The only issues we had on the flight coming home was the seat did not go back, and the plane ran out of water for the rest rooms. But the flight attendants made sure there was bottled water in the rest rooms so all of the passengers could wash their hands. Other than that, it was purely smooth flying!!!"},

All well and good. What you are not told by JetBlue is that they are booking you in an Iceland Air fare class called \"Economy Light\", which does not include a checked bag. You are not given a choice on this. And you won't even discover this fee until you are standing at the counter at JFK. At no point during JetBlue's online booking process are you ever asked about baggage (or seat selection for that matter).\n\nIceland Air will tell you it's JetBlue's problem, and Iceland Air makes it kind of a process to even pay for the bag. It's hard to imagine this is standard practice. But be forewarned that you will be charged for baggage. It may be advisable to book directly through Iceland Air, where you will be presented with a choice of fare class (and seat selection)."},

In other cases, it depended on which of the conflicting stories you believed. But my (additional) complaints are (i) how the staff handled the flight once we boarded, and (ii) the condition of the equipment. The staff were either silent and uninvolved or nasty, impatient and intimidating, inciting other passengers to turn their anger toward some passengers who justifiably were consideting getting off the plane after we finally boarded and then had to sit and sit on the runway. Our entertainment units did not work, and we were told that the staff would give us vouchers, then that they didn't have them and we would need to contact the airline. the airline did send us vouchers, as well as coupons for our next flight, but really, the experience was bad enough that they should have given full refunds. As to the equipment condition, the photos of the back of the seat in front of me (below) tell the story. Note that the conditions shown are not related to the quick turnaround of the plan because of the delay. They are obviously from extended and long-term neglect.

Had our flights checked in on line the day before. We arrived with our AWAY luggage and had it checked in with no problems. We then all went through security with no problems, and went to sit at the area where our gate was. 30 minutes prior to the doors closing they called our names stating there was a problem with our luggage they had the batteries in the baggage in which we were not aware it could not be there. We purchased the away luggage because one of the biggest selling points were the chargeable batteries, this being our first flight we did not know they could not be installed in the bags where they belong. Later on one of the workers there told me they wish they would stop selling the AWAY bags as this has become a problem. Knowing that they should put up some type of signage stating if you have luggage equipped with batteries, they must be removed. They told us to hurry and sent us to a location where they stated our luggage would be there to pop out the batteries and make it back before they take off. They sent us to the wrong location stating our luggage would be there, that department sent us to the right location and our luggage was not there to remove the batteries. We waited so long for them to get the bags, moved so slow they could care less that this trip cost us $9,000 total including straight flight from Boston to Punta Cana and back, all inclusive resort for 7 days and a van to and from the resort. Finally they retrieved our bags we took the batteries out they had us place our 4 bags again at the baggage area and go to security, if they would have put us through the security quicker stating we had already been there we would have made the flight instead they stated we had to wait in line. I recieved a call from the flight attendant stating they were closing the doors and we would not make the flight and if I would give permission for my 14 year old child to travel with our older family members putting them in charge of her as she was a minor. I consented as they were on the plane already and thankfully I had my family members there I trust with all my heart. They made us miss our flight, separated us from our kids who were now on the flight with our family. I paid extra money for a straight flight. They took us out of the security line went to retrieve our bags again so they would no be on that plane and had us rebook two tickets one for me and my fiance the only ones they had available were to leave at 1:30 to JFK and then after 1.5 hours to Punta cana. We retrieved the tickets again checked in our bags and went through security. The flight attendants were very nice and explained everything on the plane where things were if needed. Instead of arriving at 12 noon in Punta Cana We arrived at 6PM after customs and everything we had to go through and the drive we arrived at 8:30 PM that night. My daughters were so happy to see us and I later found out the youngest one had cried she was afraid something would happen to us. There was no urgency on there part of taking care of passengers who paid so much money for a flight, no care or compassion for what occurred. Not even an apology. I will be posting this on multiple other sites as I do not want this happening to anyone else and feel this is unfair. We all work hard for our money in order to be able to take a vacation I missed a whole day of mine because they couldn't just take an extra step to help us. I'm very disappointed in Jet Blue. We will be taking many more vacations but I do not believe Jet Blue will be getting our money any more and from what I read on the other comments it looks that way for other people also. Thank you to anyone who has read this and understands my situation. I also paid extra $ to have a straight flight it is over a month later and bot one person has reached out to me and I'm owed money as I did not get my straight flight.

The DC flight arrived past 6 so of course we lost our connecting flight. JetBlue got us a hotel in DC so that we could take a noon flight to Orlando and the same 8:30pm flight to Bogota. While in Orlando the next day, after losing a full day we expected to be with family, the flight to Bogota got delayed twice to 10:20pm because of bad weather. When we complained and asked for compensation for the whole ordeal, they informed us they do not compensate for weather delays and we were already compensated for the flight we lost by buying us a hotel. Imagine thinking buying a hotel to 2 stranded passangers, that the company itself stranded, to catch a flight the next day is compensation and nothing short of their responsibility as an airline to get us to our destination safely as 2 already paying customers. Furthermore the man we talked to threatened to not allow me to fly to Bogota after calling him and their company useless and saying the word \"bulls**\" once out of anger. I can not give them a bad enough rating. Avoid this airline with everything you can, they are totally useless and ineffective at everything they do, including transporting passengers as an airline. The only thing they are good for is threatening and scaring paying customers for fear of not being able to see their family who are waiting for them. I hope they go bankrupt."},

I preface my review like this because we had the most terrible 5 and half hour experience on JetBlue, returning home to San Diego from Boston July 10th. A baby directly behind us literally screamed from take off until touch down (with the exception of about a half hour nap). Her father who sat in the middle with her at the window and another toddler on the aisle (who at times, egged her younger sister on), seemed to be completely mute for the entirety of the trip. His wife, who sat across the aisle, with another young child did not intervene either. The flight attendant offered us ear plugs and a drink. My husband and I were not the only travelers who arrived in San Diego completely depleted from the whole experience. I said early on that we are grandparents although our grandkids are now 11 and 14 - they are on their 2nd passports (so young seasoned travelers), but when they were small, traveling from NYC to visit us in California, they never screamed across the United States, and when they were upset, their parents made concerted efforts to calm them. If it ws not feasible to move us, then the father should have been asked to bring his infant to the galley and sit with her until she was calm. We really have never experienced such an unpleasant flight. It has completely soured us on JetBlue."},

      {"source": "tripadvisor", "username":"Elizabeth wrote a review Jul 2019\n1 contribution1 helpful vote","categories":["Punta Cana - Fort Lauderdale","International","Economy"],"content":"We were with a total of 10 passengers. We were supposed to get on a flight from Punta Cana to Puerto Rico at 3:21 pm on July 12, 2019. ON the morning of July 12 at 8:51 AM we received an email stating that the flight was delayed to 4:33 pm. This concerned us due to the fact that our connecting flight to our final destination of Fort-Lauderdale was at 6:00 pm. As a result of our concern, and as recommended by the aforementioned email, we got to the airport at 1 PM, with 3 hours to spare. When our group got to the counter to get our boarding passes and inquire about the status of the connection due to the delay ( a flight that we had already checked in for the night before AND paid checked bags) we were told that they were aware of our reservation, since we were such a large group, and that they were waiting for us to arrive to let us know that we would not be able to make the connecting flight because of the need to go through security and pick up our checked bags upon our arrival to Puerto Rico. They repeatedly stressed that flying to Puerto Rico on the delayed flight was not an option because we would not make the connection.They also told us, very matter of factly, that they had a previous flight that they were hoping to board us on (a direct flight from Punta Cana to Fort Lauderdale that departed at 2:20 PM) but they could no longer place us on that flight because the gates had closed and that had we gotten to the airport earlier, they could have placed us all on that flight. At this point, it is important to once again mention that we had arrived at the airport 3 HOURS BEFORE OUR ORIGINAL DEPARTURE TIME. We asked why they did not notify us to get to the airport earlier through email, phone or any form of communication (as they clearly had our information and knew prior to our arrival that we would not make our connection due to a delay of your airline) and were met with blank stares and remarks that that was not their responsibility. Never, were we notified either by a call, text message or email, about this earlier flight so there was no way that we could have known that was an option. Not only was the Jet Blue Staff at Punta Cana Airport COMPLETELY AWARE that there was a group of 10 passengers that was not going to make their flights, but they FAILED to inform us that we could arrive for an earlier flight and then blamed us for not being there on time for the supposed earlier flight. We were treated with complete and utter disrespect and the options given to us were outrageous, like flying to Puerto Rico and then at 9 PM flying to New York and from New York to Fort Lauderlade making our flying time double to triple the time. The (very few) options provided were not suitable for us because we had to be home to get to our jobs and responsibilities. We were told by a staff member named Arysleidis (who refused to provide her last name OR the name of her supervisor) that was very unprofessional, that our only option would be to purchase another flight with another airline and cancel our JetBlue flight and that we would be able to get our money back from our JetBlue flights. Our only option to fly out of Punta Cana on July 12 was to book all new tickets on an American Airlines flight, including 4 in business class (because it was all they had left) so we could all leave. We spent several hours dealing with poor enthusiasm and work ethic on the part of the JetBlue Punta Cana Airport Staff, to the point where we almost missed the new American Airlines flight because we were waiting for the Jet Blue Refund WE WERE PROMISED upon cancelation, only to be told that we would not be getting a refund from them because we had purchased the tickets through Bookit. We were also told that we had 24 hours to call and request the refund and when we asked what would happen if we could not make it home in 24 hours to make the call they responded that was not their problem. At 3:52 PM when we had JUST BOARDED the American Airlines Flight we got a text message saying that the flight from Puerto Rico to Fort-Lauderdale was delayed an hour and was now departing at 7:10 PM. Meaning, we could have made our original delayed flight, even after being LIED TO and told repeatedly that we would not be able to make the connection. So after being mistreated by your staff, experiencing the lack of professionalism of your company and the poor communication given to your costumers we all want back every penny of our hard earned money, NOT in the form of a voucher or airline credit but in our original form of purchase because after this experience we do not want anything to do with Jet Blue. We are not opposed to and will result in taking legal action and going public with our experience on all social media and public stations. This entire experience has been completely unacceptable and has ruined what was supposed to be a relaxing and pleasant family experience."},

No one had information if our original flight was going to be cancelled or not. We later found out, it was delayed by more than 6 hours and took off at 2:24 am. When asked if JetBlue would pay for our hotel stay and transportation to and from the hotel, no one had information either but we were told to keep our receipts which we did.\nI submitted a reimbursement claim with JetBlue once we got home and it was denied. The airline basically said that delays happen and they did not reimburse for \"consequential expenses\".

Not so bad for the person behind me, but now I had a seat belt to lean against, and I wasn't even asked if it was OK or offered to move somewhere else....the flight was not full. The arm rest across the aisle from me was cracked so badly that it was falling off the arm rest. And if that wasn't enough the flight attendants were rude and just seemed to be anxious to be done with whatever they were doing. Thanks Jet Blue, I'll fly another airline next time.....and you really should retire that aircraft, or at least spend some money to update the interior."},

Our flight from Hartford to FLL was delayed due to both mechanical and weather issues by over three hours which as a result would make us miss our connecting flight from FLL to Costa Rica. JetBlue had to move us to a flight to the following day making us miss a whole day of our vacation. Apparently JetBlue has no agreements with any other airlines when it comes to accommodating their customers to try to find other available flight options. According to JetBlue rules, passengers are entitled to $250 credit when their flights are delayed for more than 6 hours when unrelated to weather. Our flight was delayed by 24 hours due to both mechanical and weather conditions, however, JetBlue refused to compensate because they are blaming the weather only, even though I have an official JetBlue email stating both mechanical and weather being the cause of the delay. After a big fight on the phone, finally got $75 per person credit to be used within a year."},

My son and his wife left NYC to fly home on Saturday, July 6, 2019. Their flight was delayed to weather several times, and after 8 hours of delays - at midnight they were told there were maintenance problems so the flight was canceled. The next flight they could get them on was Tuesday, July 9th (due to the holiday weekend and cancelled flights that had to be rebooked), and then they could only get them to LA, so they were going to have to rent a car to get home to San Diego - at their own expense. Jet Blue has a policy that (1) they will NOT send you out on another airline, you have to fly out Jet Blue, and (2) they will NOT reimburse your hotel room waiting for your next flight out. My son and his wife were lucky in that they could afford to find a hotel room at the last minute in NYC for three nights, and they could afford the cab ride back and forth, and expenses to stay in the city another 3 days. Other flyers with kids and other groups of older people who complained to JB about the costs and that all the hotel rooms were booked due to the holiday weekend were ust out of luck. Granted it was a holiday weekend and things happen, but I can't imagine what some of the other families went through. So, we also came home from NYC last night, 7/13/19 and we arrive in Vegas and alas - no luggage. They tell us they will deliver to our hotel at 11 pm last night. It is now 10 am on Sunday 7/15/19 and it somewhere (they don't know where) with the deliver company and will come \"some time\" today. Well, were very very lucky in that when we got in at 8 pm last night we already planned to spend the night in Vegas since we live several hours away. We are also lucky we don't have a flight home and can sit around in the hotel lobby and waste the day away waiting for our luggage. Lesson learned? I will only fly Jet Blue if I am not in a hurry to get somewhere, can afford to stay at the location I am going, and have no deadlines or restrictions. And even then, I probably won't fly Jet Blue again..."},

We knew when we booked the tickets that we'd have a long layover at FLL, but that is the challenge trying to make connections with JetBlue rather than flying on their non-stop service as we normally do. This trip was complicated by heavy weather in FLL (but great weather in JAX and BDL) and a runway closure at FLL (for maintenance). While the weather issue was not foreseeable, the runway closure was--in fact, JetBlue gave us a heads up about that several days before. What disappointed us was that fact that JetBlue seemed operationally incapable of dealing with the runway closure--other than to delay all flights. Frankly, it would have been more honest of them to cancel flights well in advance and rebook people on alternate itineraries where possible (which would have included us). In the end, we arrived at our destination safely with all of our luggage, with is one fundamental measure of a successful flight. It took us 19 hours, though, which would have been plenty of time for us to drive from JAX to BDL (a thought which did cross our minds).

If I am not mistaken there are some regulations about four people, two adults and two children, placed in three seats I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the FAA or the TSA or the NTSB, but there must be some rule about that somewhere. The two children cried and screamed for the 90 minute flight from Bermuda to New York. I summoned the flight attendant and asked her to switch to another row and she would only see us one row behind the people with the children, which was not adequate. I explained that there was another row two rows up that was completely empty and please arrange for us to sit there. She did not and her response was those seats were more expensive and if I set you there I would have to explain to other people why. The reason why was because they were kicking and screaming children behind us for 90 minutes. I said that was unacceptable and she then called Shavon, The head cabin attendant. I explained that we were uncomfortable with the kicking and screaming, and she explained that even though there was an empty row, there was nothing she could do about it.

She made three calls and still no one came. The Lounge attendant left the lounge to roam the hall and looked for someone to help me get my 87 year old husband to the gate. I walked over to two different nearby Jetblue gate attendants to try to get assistance. When someone finally showed up, the person had to run with my husband's wheelchair to make the plane.

It was scheduled to depart on Saturday, July 6, 2019. After checking out of my hotel and getting ready for the airport I received an email about my flight being cancelled. I called and waited for customer service for 30mins just to get hung up on. I called back, waited another 30 mins just for the rude customer service rep to tell me my flight was indeed cancelled due to weather conditions and the next flight wouldn't be available until Monday. I found this very ironic for the reasoning as there weren't any rain storms etc. expected at that time. EVERY other flight departed. The nonchalant rep then stated she could simply give me a refund but that would be all.\nAfter searching I found a one way ticket (the cheapest) for $817.00 with another airline. I rushed to the airport only to find out that flight had a 20hr layover which caused me to have to book another hotel now in Seattle (at midnight). Being a young, petite female by myself I felt my safety was at risk and I was literally left stranded by Jet blue.\nSome people aren't as blessed as I was to be able to book another flight or hotel. What would have happened if I was one of those people? Jet blue did not care. They simply reiterated they could refund the $268 I originally spent not offering anything more. I would NEVER recommend Jet Blue to ANYONE!"},

While waiting for our flight, they called my name and asked if myself and my neice could move our seats so they could accommodate a family to sit together. No problem I said, so we were moved to another seat.\nUpon lining up to board, behind me was a growling dog in a carrier, I am deathly afraid of dogs and asked what row the dog was in, of course, it was behind me and the carrier would be under my seat! I asked to be moved and was told rudely by a JetBlue rep, \"you agreed to the move!\" Another agent moved us and unfortunately, this time, they put us in the only seats on the plane without a working tv! I discussed it with the stewardess immediately once we boarded and she advised she would move us if possible and offer a credit. Another JB stewardess came over and said, \"whats the big deal, its only a tv\"! No it was not only a tv, after the growling dog sending me into panic mode, it was MY EMOTIONAL SUPPORT that I needed to calm myself after the dog fiasco. JetBlue accommodated a famiiy to keep together, then a dog and we were told, they would separate us! My seats were booked for 6 months for which I paid $800 and to keep a family together and then accommodate a dog, my neice and I get the Jetblue rude attitude and to solve the problem, they are going to separate us? At the end of the flight, I inquired about the voucher, I was told I'd have to telephone Jet blue by the stewardess. I insisted she put it through and alas we were granted a $15 voucher! The last time I flew Jetblue was 2+ years ago due to three dogs, two being held on laps and one in a carrier, all seated near me and worse, is the rudeness of the JetBlue personnel. This is the second time, I have flown JetBlue and both times, they succeeded in ruining my vacations with young familiy members! Since Jetblue pushes the fly your pet thing, perhaps they need to announce on flights when there are dogs on the plane so people with issues can be accommodated NOT the dogs! Jetblue representative and stewardesses ALL need lessons on customer service and learn how to accommodate paying passengers"},

The seats are comfortable with a surprising amount of leg room and they don't skimp on the snacks. They also offered to check our carry ons at the gate since overhead space was limited - big bonus when traveling with six 16 year olds.\n\nMy daughter doesn't do well with new situations and was very apprehensive about her first flight, but we found that the YouTube series 'Worth It' had reviewed JetBlue so she was able to see in advance what the flight would be like, which did a lot to calm her fears. Google it if you want to see for yourself how much legroom there is.\n\nI took a trip back to Disneyland last year with friends (and highly recommend going as adults - it's a whole different Disney when you don't have to work around what the kids want to do!) and didn't even check prices on the other airlines, just went straight to JetBlue. The tickets were very reasonably priced, the flight is comfortable and the timing of the flights means you get to spend most of your flight days - arriving and departing - in the park. Highly recommended!"},

And I switch between JetBlue and United mostly because of the schedule. JB only has a few flights on this route while United has more. In the past I would always check jb first and settle for United. For the past 18 months though it‚Äôs the other way around. It‚Äôs like JB forgot how to run an airline? Always late always oversold. Plane packed with an angry crowd. Yea the TVs help and once you take off they are ok but you get the feeling though even the flight attendants are pissed off. They can‚Äôt wait to get done. Sure everyone is on edge. Today I had a flight scheduled for 5pm we took off after 9pm. I had an exit row seat, even more seat which of course I paid .... even more. But it was ok. They‚Äôve refurbished the interior new seats new TVs outlets for your iPhone. Good. Service good. Just the damn delay. The pilot said it was due to a mechanical issue. Great did he have to say that? Now being as neurotic as I am I‚Äôm wondering what kind of shape the plane is really in??? How many miles on this thing? Who‚Äôs working on it? Mr good wrench or jiffy lube?? Anyway it all turned out ok bags cane off quick. Terminal A at Newark though is still a dive. Meanwhile terminal C for United is like the mall of America. Who‚Äôs making these decisions? JetBlue was a dream come true when it came in the scene. They were putting the humanity back into air travel they used to say. I think since they fired the founder, they went back in that. I can picture the discussion ‚Äúhey we need to pick up on the profits and back off on the humanity..... ok people?? ‚Äú\nI hope they figure it out because right now I‚Äôll fly United unless I have no choice to fly JetBlue. I hate saying that. It really gives me the blues."},

With family in NY and me living in San Diego I usually find that flying JetBlue is the only way to go.\n\nBut this latest flight: Flight 89 from JFK to SD on July 9, 2019 had the laziest flight crew! I hit the overhead button for service and not one, not two, but THREE attendants passed by and never stopped to ask what we needed. I actually wanted to purchase two UP meal boxes, so if they wanted to stop an Even More customer from buying even more, then I guess that's one way to do it.\n\nI actually did walk to the back to the flight attendants since my daughter was still hungry, and saw they were sitting in the back busy on their smartphones. I asked if the process changed and they no longer answer to the call button, and do the passengers need to get out of our seats for service. The flight attendant said, \"Either way.\" No apology, nothing.\n\nThey barely came around to collect trash and were, in general, unpleasant and seeming unhappy to be there.\n\nWhat happened, JetBlue? You used to have great service in addition to great planes with comfy seats and entertainment options. Although the planes and entertainment are still great, all I can remember and tell people about is the horrible and lazy service me and my family received. I'll think twice before booking a flight out to NY again!"},

Now I am considering quitting well-planned, well-budgeted air travel all together. I feel very mistreated by jetBlue, and I am a True Blue member (which I know, means very little these days). When I booked this trip months in advance, I selected and paid for seats on a flight that was a six-seat across (3-3) plane. When checking in the day before the early morning flight, I saw it was now a four-seat across flight. I didn't realize that meant that there would be NO SPACE for carry on luggage (I always plan and pack carefully to avoid a checked bag). I paid full price in advance like everyone else on the plane. I am the person who actually waits for my boarding group to be called. I don't push others out of the way to get on the plane. Well, by the time my family boarded, there was no overhead space left. The RUDE flight attendant would not help at all. There were people who put their small personal items in the overhead space to avoid having anything at their feet. There were people who boarded the plane before us with WAY TOO MANY personal items. NO ONE was helping or monitoring the boarding and bag policies. I paid for an overhead and a personal item for each of my tickets, and had to check bags. When I asked a flight attendant for help, he rudely told me that helping with the carry-on baggage was \"not his job.\" Wow! Is it MY JOB?? Because I saw exactly who boarded with TWO personal items and whose tiny bags were overhead instead of stored under the seat. I have NEVER been treated so badly on a flight, not EVEN SPIRIT! Yikes.

On both flights to and from Ecuador, either my husband or I had a broken tray table. On the return flight to FLL, my husband's video screen kept randomly turning back on after he'd dimmed it so that he could sleep. On both flights, the seats did not recline, which was very uncomfortable. It was impossible to sleep.\n\nAlso, on the flight back to FLL, a woman was struggling to put her bag into the overhead bin prior to departing the gate. She was the last and only person standing. The flight attendant repeated his command more than THREE times in just a few seconds for all passengers to be seated so that we could leave the gate. (Rude!) He could have just helped her with her suitcase instead of playing drill sergeant over the PA system.\n\nFinally, although our return flight to FLL did arrive early, we were not allowed to deboard the plane until US Customs opened at 5am. That meant we had to sit on the plane for about 20 minutes. Okay, that's understandable. However, when we were finally allowed to deboard, the power to the plane shut off!!!! I'm not sure if that's a plane problem, or an airport problem, but it sure was a problem. It was dark! A nice passenger near me stayed behind to light the way with the flashlight on his phone. However, I never saw any of the flight attendants leaping up to assist.\n\nThere were some good things about this flight. First, the flight attendants did a good job making sure people loaded their suitcases properly into the overhead bins, (i.e., roll-around suitcases sit on their sides in order to take up less space). Second, the plane did not crash and we all arrived safely."},

I was reluctant to fly with them but they provided a nonstop service at a reasonable rate. Let‚Äôs face it price drives everything when it comes to flying and a vacation. Almost a year ago I took a flight from Fort Lauderdale to New Hampshire for work. They had booked me on JetBlue. It didn‚Äôt bother me that the flight was delayed 5 1/2 hours because I was on the clock however it makes traveling very undesirable. JetBlue offered no alternative and it wasn‚Äôt until I complained that this was unacceptable granted I know some circumstances are Unavoidable like weather or lack of airline personnel. By the 4th hour of our delay I called jet blue and expressed my thoughts! They granted me a credit for future use, which brings us to this trip to Costa Rica. Again delayed again I get it they can‚Äôt control the weather. Upon approaching Costa Rica we were just about to land and the plane starting to ascend. That‚Äôs was contributed to poor visibility so we got redirected to another airport for fuel which delayed us yet again! Finally got air bound again to SJO airport. We were supposed to arrive in SJO at 2:00pm we didn‚Äôt get to our hotel till 11:30 that night ! On the way home delayed 2 hours for what reason we will never know. So my finally verdict on jet blue is to find alternative! At least with Spirit you can expect all the mishaps and delays!"},

On one flight i had a minor issue as the TV was not working. The attendant was unable to fix the issue but offered other perks to make up for the problem.\n\nI would be remiss if i did not also share the unpleasant experience on Jet Blue where the \"rules\" interfered with customer comfort. When i contacted Jet Blue about the issue i was informed that those are the rules.\n\nHere is that situation in case it interests you. I was on a short flight from Oakland to Long Beach. I was sitting next to two passengers who were bouncing and shaking their legs which i experienced as mildly unpleasant. . Since the flight was half empty, after about 20-30 minutes i changed seats. I was comfortably situated in my new seat for 10-15 minutes (in an empty row in the coach section of the plane) when the flight attendant politely asked me if i had paid for that seat. I explained the situation to her and she informed me that i could not stay in that seat if i had not paid for it. She told me I would have to move to another seat in the back of the plane. By this time, there were perhaps 30 minutes (maybe less) of flight time. I moved seats. I later contacted jet blue gave the flight attendant's name and was informed that she had acted just as Jet Blue wanted her to. I do understand rules but, seriously, was that necessary. After that i chose not to fly Jet Blue for years until recently when i was \"forced\" to fly with them because of the route and times i needed.\n\nAs indicated above my recent experience was very pleasant.
