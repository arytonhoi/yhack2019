A cancellation fee I understand... but to then give me a ‚Äúvoucher‚Äù for the rest of my money to only use at jetblue?! So, what you‚Äôre saying.. is that I pay you a fee and then get no money back. You get to keep all my money like a regular scam. Right.. and here we thought you cared about customers"},

So far they pushed back this flight twice originally supposed to leave at 10:02, then they pushed it back to 12 now it‚Äôs pushed to 1:50. We booked a non refundable flight but if the airline pushes your flight back more than 2hrs they have to refund you. So okay I‚Äôm aggravated after paying all this money, they keep pushing the flight back So I call them up to cancel the flight wait on hold for six minutes, Celeste picks up the phone ‚Äúthanks for calling jet blue my name is Celeste‚Äù ‚Äúhi Celeste I had a flight that was....hello, hello...‚Äù yup Celeste hung up on me. Way to go Jet Blue. Such a shame because I hate to admit it but my best flights have always been with jet blue, once you get on the plane your fine. From my experience the captains are usually very pleasant if there‚Äôs turbulence they get on the speaker to try to make you comfortable and for some reason (and maybe it‚Äôs a coincidence) but i‚Äôve experienced less turbulence on JetBlue than any other airline. But man you people got to get it together. It‚Äôs become common place for you to push back your flights my 75-year-old mother was waiting in the airport for four hours for a flight because you kept pushing it back. Well I will say this you‚Äôre no where near as bad as us air/American airlines at least you don‚Äôt lose our luggage. But please get it together.."},
    {"source":"facebook","username":"Eva Avleeva","date":"Jul 20","content":"I have used JetBlue airlines twice in the past two months and have had a terrible experience both times. With the first flight, my flight from Orlando to New-York got delayed a couple times. Therefore, I did not make it the next flight from New-York to Moscow. When I asked if they would assist me with a hotel since they caused me to miss my connecting flight, I got a response that the hotel that they have a contract with is full. I spent the next 17 hours in the airport. UNACCEPTABLE for a company that claims to take care of their customers. Now I am flying JetBlue again as part of my return trip and my terrible experience has continued. After the second flight from Moscow to Washington which was a 10+ hour flight, I have to spend another night at the airport BECAUSE OF JETBLUE. My final flight of the trip (the JetBlue flight) from Washington to Orlando has been delayed 9 times so far and I am still waiting!!! Like literally sitting here waiting for the last four hours... and the flight has been delayed again and is expected to leave 2 hours from now... as long as it doesn‚Äôt get delayed AGAIN. The customer service desk now says that they cannot do anything like provide a hotel or rebook unless the flight gets cancelled... AT WHAT POINT DOES THE FLIGHT GET CANCELLED? AT THIS POINT WE WILL BE TAKING OFF 6 HOURS AFTER IT WAS SCHEDULED... INTO THE NEXT DAY! HOW LONG WILL THE DELAYS CONTINUE... UNTIL WE RUN INTO YOUR NEXT SCHEDULED FLIGHT TOMORROW? I still cannot get a hotel so I guess I will have to spend another night at the airport. I have flown quite extensively both within the US and internationally. This is my first experience using JetBlue as part of this most recent round trip. I will seriously have to consider before booking JetBlue as part of any of my flights. This has been a terrible experience and a terrible first impression!!"},
    {"source":"facebook","username":"Felisha Ali","date":"Apr 8","content":"Flight 1818 departed Port of Spain, Trinidad on Sunday April 7th at 341pm. It was supposed to be a nonstop flight arriving at JFK at 910 pm. At the gate in POS we were told the plane would need to make a stop in Fort Lauderdale for fuel. This caused a lot of confusion and concern for passengers- why did the plane not have enough fuel? Why were we flying on a plane that was not properly fueled? We boarded the plane and the pilot informed us that the plane was due for some maintenance and today was the expiration date for required maintanence. He also stated that the parts were not available in NY which is why the plane needed to go to FLL. This caused a lot of concern for passengers as to why Jetblue did not complete required maintanence prior to the expiration and why we were flying a plane that was not in the appropriate condition. Passengers were worried and confused especially given recent plane crashes. We made it to FLL around 820PM and went through customs, had to recheck our bags and get new boarding passes. Our boarding passes said the flight would leave at 1130 PM. There was no gate number on the tickets and the airport boards displayed an 845 departure time. Upon arriving at the gate we were told they were going to try to board earlier than the intended time. We finally boarded around 11pm and were ready for take off until the pilot once again informed us that there was an error showing up that needed to be checked. While we waited as the crew checked, we were told the plane had no food and they were not allowed to serve any beverages besides water. They said all the food places in the terminal were closed. Around 1215am the plane finally left the gate but ended up sitting in place until around 1am when the pilot told us we needed to return to the gate and deplane bc of a mechanical issue. We are all now sitting at the gate in fort lauderdale. We cant step out bc tsa is closed and we wont be able to get back in. Our new departure time is estimated to be around 5 am while we wait for a new plane and flight crew. We cant get anything from our bags that were checked in. We asked for a hotel for the night but the attendants have informed us they are all booked. Many individuals have work in the morning and need to call out or start late because of this issue. How is Jetblue going to fix that? This situation is unacceptable. We are all extremely disappointed by jetblue and their communication and decision making during this situation. By not keeping your planes up to the appropriate standards you have caused distress for all of the passengers of flight 1818. We felt unsafe from the time we left port of Spain and reboarded the plane in FLL. I have always trusted jetblue and chosen them even when prices are higher. They have to reevaluate their priorities and put their customers first. I hope you will put customers first and handle any situations better in the future. How are you going to fix this?"},

The two monoitors I had in one suit case were put back front to back instead of front to front which caused the monitor facing the back of the other monitor to get crushed. This set me back $500 dollars. I tryed to call them but they said with out proof they can't help me. I am very disappointed with Jetblue."},

    {"source":"facebook","username":"Brandon Gesimondo-Clark","date":"Aug 18","content":"My flight out of Phoenix was delayed by 50 minutes. I was told the plane would arrive 20 minutes prior to my connecting flight to Bogota leaving. Since I was checking a bag, they said it wouldn't be possible to make the connecting flight. There were multiple people in front of me who were in the same situation. I asked it they would hold that flight, as other airlines have done so when they have multiple passengers affected. I was told no, and what was supposed to be an 8 hour journey has turned into 24 hours of hopping through multiple connections. I'm now on one of my multiple connections. I decided to track my original flight and it landed early, which would have given them enough time to transfer my bags and me walk two gates down to my connecting flight! With my work schedule this year I haven't been to see my significant other for 6 months, and you're delaying that because you dont know when your planes will be able to land. When I explained why I was frustrated that they wouldn't hold the plane, person at the check in counter replied that this was a good thing because my girlfriend will be even more happy to see me now that my because she gets to wait longer. Horrible service, and a very unempathtic employee at your checkin counter. Why would I ever fly with you again?"},

This is kind of joke with me? This is not how it is works, if you promise to your clients you have to keep the promise. We ‚Äúslept‚Äù on the floor without food or water in the coldest floor and high air condition for more than 9 hours. This is how JetBlue treat their clients. I always used to choose JetBlue because they are suppose be the best company in US, unfortunately it is not true, I found this out to the hardest way.

I have a senior parent waiting for a flight at swf RIGHT NOW that was scheduled for 7:54 pm. And it looks like she won‚Äôt depart until 11:25pm. This is not right! Your crew knows it‚Äôs going to be a delayed flight every time we show up for this flight and they can‚Äôt do anything about it. I am frustrated that corporate doesn‚Äôt realize to change the schedule to allow for the delays you always have. It‚Äôs not fair to your customers and to your staff. Wake up and change the things that don‚Äôt work jet blue! The crew on the ground hears your customers and can‚Äôt do anything unless it comes from the top.

Then, once again July 23 they canceled my flight without any contact, and not to mention rerouted my following flight to an airport that is one hour and a half away.

It was very important for us to get home in a timely fashion. I tried for over 5 hours over the week-end to make this change thru our 3rd party booker with no success & much hold time stress!!!

Which is 40 mins away. Originally an 11:00 am flight that has still not taken off (it's almost 5:30). And we were repeatedly lied to about timing. This is beyond unacceptable and your customer service person, Marcy, could have cared less. Pretty sure you have a plane full of people who will not be pacified by a voucher. How does a system break down this badly? Did I mention we have our not even 3 year old with us? If you had just been honest about the delay, we could have booked another flight. But lie after lie until all other options were booked. Flight 147, Oakland to Long Beach. Get it together."}
