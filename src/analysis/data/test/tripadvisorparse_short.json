What a friendly crew! Pilot did an outstanding job getting us to our destination safely and early. Big shout-out to MateÃ³. I like that you took the time to greet the passengers by name while you asked what would they like to drink. COOL! ðŸ˜Ž"},

I appreciate that. Boarding was really in order and the flight attendants were top of the line. Only improvement area is the in fly internet. It was really complicated to use it and there were not really clear instructions. But for the rest it was a flight I will definitely suggest to others."},
