Karen F,FLL airport // rainbow,facebook,07/23,negative,"Dear #jetblue I want to take a second to compliment one of your employees Karen F at FLL airport. She was the rainbow in a very difficult day that ended with a cancelled flight. She was professional, kind and hard working. I hope you give her a raise. Please contact me if you need more information."
Celeste I,Jacksonville // Fort Lauderdale,facebook,07/2019,negative,"My mother & I had a flight booked tonight from Fort Lauderdale to Jacksonville (an hour flight) by the time everything is said & done $654. So far they pushed back this flight twice originally supposed to leave at 10:02, then they pushed it back to 12 now it’s pushed to 1:50. We booked a non refundable flight but if the airline pushes your flight back more than 2hrs they have to refund you. So okay I’m aggravated after paying all this money, they keep pushing the flight back So I call them up to cancel the flight wait on hold for six minutes, Celeste picks up the phone “thanks for calling jet blue my name is Celeste” “hi Celeste I had a flight that was....hello, hello...” yup Celeste hung up on me. Way to go Jet Blue. Such a shame because I hate to admit it but my best flights have always been with jet blue, once you get on the plane your fine. From my experience the captains are usually very pleasant if there’s turbulence they get on the speaker to try to make you comfortable and for some reason (and maybe it’s a coincidence) but i’ve experienced less turbulence on JetBlue than any other airline. But man you people got to get it together. It’s become common place for you to push back your flights my 75-year-old mother was waiting in the airport for four hours for a flight because you kept pushing it back. Well I will say this you’re no where near as bad as us air/American airlines at least you don’t lose our luggage. But please get it together.."
🐘🐘🐘💕💕💕💕,JFK // Seattle,facebook,09/01,positive,"A very special thank you to a special cabin attendant, Flight 263 from JFK to Seattle, today, August 31. You surprised me with a gift bag and a big chocolate cookie. How very sweet of you and how delightful for me!. Going to open now! Happy we share a love of the The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust. It is amazing to receive a lovely gift with your kind message! 🐘🐘🐘💕💕💕💕"
"BOS 8, Melinda",ATL // Boston,facebook,08/20,negative,"My bag was left in ATL when I flew out to BOS 8/8 and returned 8/11 it’s going on two weeks after me myself has kept contact and reached out to jet blue Boston, fedex and Baggage report service jet blue. After calling all three making sure my bag is being handled and dealt with I’ve gotten nothing but an attitude and mistreated by Miss Melinda at jet blue Boston because she was about to clock out apparently which isn’t my concern at all. My bag has sensitive items including my birth certificate and lost a job opportunity because of all this. I’m dissatisfied with their customer service and carefree attitude with how I’m feeling with my belongings not being in my home."
Melanie,Atlanta // New York,facebook,08/09,negative,I am on flight number 520 from Atlanta to New York and have been extremely mistreated with your ground staff named Melanie. She was discriminating and extremely impolite in her behavior. She forced me to check my husband and my bag when there were 10 other people ahead of us taking their bags. This has been a terrible experience!
"Monica, Chris&Ms.Sandy, Danielle, Tracie",Vegas // LongBeach Airport,facebook,08/07,positive,"I'll just leave this here. My official review and ThankU to all Jetblue employees on my travel day 09-10-19. Beginning with Tracie my boarding pass agent in Vegas to the whole crew at LongBeach Airport. Ms.Danielle, Mr.Chris&Ms.Sandy( i put them 2gether because they were like a team, dynamic duo), thanks4the ""tough love"" GROUP HUG!:) Ms.Monica and the lady who was so quick to retrieve my bag from baggage, so i could board a southewest flight last minute. Everyone reminded me and i felt like Dorothy in the freaking wizard of oz, having a destination meaning so much, storms will rise and construction on runways at SFO happen, and it is about the kindness and helpful loving characters u meet along the way. a great experience on jetblue despite the situation. trueblue five starzzz. davematthewSband l o v e(:"
Karen,San Fran // Fort Lauderdale,facebook,05/15,positive,Hey JetBlue- we are currently on Flight 577 from Fort Lauderdale to San Fran and having THE BEST TIME! The service is impeccable! We have flight attendant Karen with us this AM and could not be more charmed! She was such fun and so gracious... now we are even more hooked on JetBlue- and Mint class!
Jeff,,facebook,10/08,negative,"Jeff from customer service just made my day. Thanks, Jeff!"
Rich,Logan,facebook,09/19,positive,"I don't know who Rich is in baggage at Logan, but he get's a star for the day. My parents are old, don't speak very good english and needed to get on a bus to reach me after their flight. That guy took them and their bags to their bus and even held my mom's hand getting up the first step of the bus. What??!!"
"Martha, Jackie, Cannot",Logan // Boston,facebook,08/24,positive,"Best service ever! Despite third party travel site messing up our seat assignments, Martha and Jackie at Boston/Logan found a way to seat us back together despite a full plane. Cannot thank them enough for doing this without prompting. THANK YOU!"
Heather,Flight 25 // Barbados,facebook,08/17,negative,Eh. First time flying today and overwhelming unimpressed. $5 for headphones? $30 for each bag? Seat was as uncomfortable as any one I have ever sat in. It was like an overpriced Spirit airlines. And the flight attendant “Heather” from Flight 25 from Boston to Barbados is an absolute disgrace to your organization. Rude as any human I have ever met. And I didn’t even talk to her just saw how she talked down to others. Feel free to PM me JetBlue if you want to talk!
Silice Betty,home // Boston,facebook,07/03,positive,"I want to compliment a JetBlue employee & want JetBlue to acknowledge this post. Sunday Jun 30, 2019 Silice Betty was working the gate at ACK. We asked her if she could put the 3 of us on the direct flight to LGA. Our luggage was already on our booked flight to Boston - then LGA! Without hesitation & utmost professionalism & kindness she went out of her way to not only switch us onto the flight, she managed to run back & forth until she accomplished switching our luggage & hand delivered to us the new luggage claim. It was very important for us to get home in a timely fashion. I tried for over 5 hours over the week-end to make this change thru our 3rd party booker with no success & much hold time stress!!! Silice Betty was definitely our week-end hero & JetBlue should be incredibly proud of such a kind & dedicated employee!!! Thank-you Silice!!!!!!!"
Marcy,airport // Oakland,facebook,08/11,negative,"Seriously JetBlue? We have spent all day at the Oakland airport waiting for a part coming from SFO. Which is 40 mins away. Originally an 11:00 am flight that has still not taken off (it's almost 5:30). And we were repeatedly lied to about timing. This is beyond unacceptable and your customer service person, Marcy, could have cared less. Pretty sure you have a plane full of people who will not be pacified by a voucher. How does a system break down this badly? Did I mention we have our not even 3 year old with us? If you had just been honest about the delay, we could have booked another flight. But lie after lie until all other options were booked. Flight 147, Oakland to Long Beach. Get it together."
Mateó,Orlando  //  Newburgh,tripadvisor,yesterday,positive,"I have flown many times before, but I must say that flight #846 with JetBlue was awesome. What a friendly crew! Pilot did an outstanding job getting us to our destination safely and early. Big shout-out to Mateó. I like that you took the time to greet the passengers by name while you asked what would they like to drink. COOL! 😎"
Dog,Boston  //  Sarasota,tripadvisor,10/22,positive,"We had a small dog, the flight was a little delayed on takeoff. Dog is under his seat and is very warm. He started to whine. Once we took off she calm down. The crew was very understanding and very cooperative with us. I would like to say thank you to the all"
"4Oct19, Amanda Zaiter, 5Oct19",Boston  //  Aruba,tripadvisor,10/04,negative,"4Oct19: 5 AM, Amanda Zaiter of Jet Blue did *not* tag my bride's bag. Wife near tears on Day One in Aruba.4Oct19: Filed claim5Oct19: JetBlue rallied and delivered bag to hotel"
JFK,Boston  //  New York City,tripadvisor,10/18,positive,"We'd arrived at Logan for a flight to Newark. Seeing a two-hour delay (it was a very windy day) I noticed the flights for JFK were on time. A visit to the JetBlue Just Ask desk got us transferred to this flight (with a surprise free upgrade to Even More Space seats) with instructions to ""walk fast - you have time but don't delay"" - we made it about 5 minutes into the boarding process. We wound up actually leaving an hour before we'd expected, and with no checked luggage we were good to go.Generally speaking, I've had very good experiences with JetBlue and have found the staff very helpful. The flight was a quick one and very comfortable."
JB,Austin  //  New York City,tripadvisor,10/20,negative,"Understandable that weather like a non existent windy bomb cyclone in NYC cancelled the flight (note: United flew into Newark around the same time), but to rebook me on the next day on a connecting flight (had a nonstop) and put me to the last row when the even more space rows were available is ridiculous. Kudos to the agent that change my first leg up, but the counter person said, no can do on the second leg.. some BS about they can't waive the fee for another city.. reminder: I had a direct flight and out a few hundred bucks already for hotel accommodation that I had to book.. due to JB's decision not to fly out.I guess AA, UA, Delta would have tried harder.."
JFK,Bridgetown  //  Portland,tripadvisor,10/26,positive,"First time flying with Jetblue. Wife and I going to a family wedding in Portland. So we awoke at 2.45am to check in at 4 am for a 6 am departure. Plane seats were doing and let space was quite comfortable as advertised. This was a pleasant surprise! Attendants were professionally pleasant and efficient. Arrived Ft. Lauderdale at 9.05 am. Connecting flight to JFK New York was at 2.54 pm! The long wait meant we were now awake for 12 hours. Flight to JFK was on different equipment and the seats weren't as comfortable as the plane was an older model. We reached New York around 6.25 pm and departed on our final leg at 8.20 pm. This was the longest flight but this Jetblue plane was identical to the first and we were both very happy for the comfortable seats, me in particular with my near 6'3"" frame. Staff were pleasant, the snacks and drinjs, while standard were a bit different, especially the blue corn chips! Kudos to the pilits. They got us there 20 minutes early! I think we had a strong tailwind or something. So we arrived but because the Portland airport wifi was woeful we could not summon an Uber. Instead of paying an estimated $28 we took a metered cab and it cost us $55. We had been up for twenty six hours by the time we entered our apartment in Downtown! Our return leg was via Boston and again it was a pleasant early flight lasting 5+ hours. To our immense relief Jetblue had scheduled our departure gate a mere two gates away from our arrival gate as our concern was the very short 1 1/4 hour connection time to Ft.Lauderdale. From Boston we returned to Florida in just over 3 hours, again on a comfortable Jetblue flight. With the exception of one of our six flight legs I found the seating comfortable and the staff professional, efficient and pleasant. I will definitely fly Jetblue again from Barbados!"
Christian,Newark  //  Boston,tripadvisor,10/26,positive,"Short ride because this was a layover connection. Only downside; My screen didn't work, but it was ok. The flight staff were so amazing. Christian was the best. So attentive and funny."
African American,New York City  //  San Juan,tripadvisor,10/19,negative,"I will NEVER fly with JetBlue EVER again.. my first flight was delayed.. the second flight (when I finally found the gate after several incorrect ones being posted) I was told it was too late and I my fiancé and I would not be allowed on (we’re same sex and African American) and from the moment we walked up and asked for help we were given this look of disgust and I couldn’t imagine why! however a flight attendant came off and said that we were no shows they should do a last call.. we told here we were there she attempted to let us on, this woman who claimed to be the manager REFUSED to let us get on. Yelling and being disgustingly rude, and then opens the door and allows another “late passenger” to get on as she rudely tells us to move. .. now we’re on flight #3 .. $90.00 in seat upgrades later just so that we can sit together.. this third flight has been delayed three times and is currently almost 2 hours past the last delayed timeframe. Your airline staff is extremely unprofessional, rude, and unaccommodating. So disappointed in this airline, what changed?! My fiancé’s birthday trip is ruined , we will not make it in time for our cruise .. but THANK you JetBlue"
Elijah,Minneapolis  //  Boston,tripadvisor,10/28,negative,"The service on our flight to Boston was good but the only bad thing was we were in the very last row and although I had a window seat, there was no window. Since it was our first time in Boston, it would have been nice to see the city as we arrived. When we left Boston we had questions and asked two different JetBlue employees for assistance, they seemed like we were irritating them and one even rolled her eyes at us. If it wasn't for our service at the gate from Elijah on our return trip, the rating would have been lower. My husband and I did not have seats together when we checked in, we were about 10 rows apart. When we got to the gate, we approached Elijah to see if there was any way we could be moved closer to each other. Elijah had already taken care of it when we got up there, he saw that we were apart and moved us to seats closer to the front and right next to each other. I think the other JetBlue employees could learn from Elijah, that is excellent customer service."
Naussu,Pittsburgh  //  Aruba,tripadvisor,10/22,negative,"I need convinced that we should use JetBlue in the future. We live in Pittsburgh and have used JetBlue for 99% of our travels.December 2018, Pgh to Naussu. We missed our connection in Lauderdale by less than 10 min due to a mech problem in Pgh before we left. Eight people for our sons wedding at the Atlantis.Had to go to the Hard Rock Casino for four hours between flights. The wedding planner said she would have to make all kinds of changes that would cost us a little more.Jet Blue credited money to our ""bank"" because of their screwup and said we had a year to use it. This was after my wife had their CS department on the phone for a few hours. No problem since we fly to the Hard Rock a few times a year. Like getting two free tickets.Oops, JetBlue STOPS all its direct Pgh to Ft. Lauderdale flights due to ""poor performance "" so NOW you have to fly from Pgh to BOSTON then on to Lauderdale.The Pgh/Boston flight is not free and adds two hours each way to your intimerary. The price for Pgh/Lauderdale was very reasonable when you didn't have to go thru Boston. Now, we had to use or lose the credit so we booked the Pgh/Boston flight to Aruba.I am sitting in Boston waiting on the one hour and fifteen min delayed plane as I type this. We are on o way back home. Problem with the plane and a change of aircraft so we have to wait for a different plane coming out of D.C.Actually, what happens is the crew times out and they don't have anyone else to take the flight. BAD schedulingThe same reason they cancelled a flight from Lauderdale to Pgh about 18 months ago and we got stuck staying at the Hard Rock for another night then taking a flight the next night.This was the ""infamous"" 50/50 flight that was supposed to leave at 8:45 pm every nightThey called it that because there was a 50/50 chance it was really going to be there.The desk person here in Boston just announced that our plane would be ready to board and it was only about 58 min delayed.Yea, I'll use Jet Blue again! LMAO"
Santo Domingo,Denver  //  Santo Domingo,tripadvisor,10/15,positive,"I took a red eye flight from Denver to Boston first. Wow, I got on the plane and everyone got a eye blinder to take a nap on the flight. It was sitting in my seat when I got on. Slept most of the time. The next flight to Santo Domingo when I was awake noticed flight attendents walking is Asile asking if anyone needed anything. Plus I had leg room and I think I was back on row 32. The other thing I noticed, they had intertanment for everyone and did not charge you for it. I could watch movies or TV shows or even listin to music which was awesome. Guess who I will fly on again."
Warnig,West Palm Beach  //  New York City,tripadvisor,10/11,negative,"I have been flying Jet Blue for the last 20 years and have always had good flights and usually on time back and forth from Florida to New York. Unfortunatly, the only bank they use for their frequent flyers is Barclaycard which is the worst credit card ever. Their customer service does not care about cardmembers, rude, uncaring and will not remove fraudulent charges even with proof and letters from witnesses. Nor do they pay attention to a forged signiture stating is is proof you signed. I have cancelled the card after months of trying to clear this and will have to fly another airline with a more reliable credit card that protects its card members. Warnig: Any one using Barclays whould get rid of it as soon as possible. Jet Blue should change to another bank."
"Bobbie, Jason",Boston  //  Orlando,tripadvisor,10/22,negative,"Worst experience by far today. I always fly JetBlue. In fact usually the ONLY airline I fly. Today I experienced the WORST customer service at Orlando airport JetBlue employees, Bobbie and Jason 'jay'"
"Rosa, Stephen",San Francisco  //  New York City,tripadvisor,10/23,positive,"Yesterday my family flew from San Francisco to JFK in Jet Blue’s Mint Class, aka Business class. Our crew was led by Stephen and Rosa. They were professional and accommodating, as well as charming. The seats are comfy and the single pod set up is the best. The only complaint I have is I wish the movie selections were better."
Mike,Long Beach  //  Seattle,tripadvisor,10/15,positive,This airline is one of my favorite! They always treat me like family. Customer service is always far and beyond. I’m so happy to fly with jet Blue my Mike is the best ! Thanks jet blue for always giving the best
"Jabanna, Jen",New York City  //  New Orleans,tripadvisor,10/17,positive,"This was my first flight ever and it was awesome. Romaine, Jen and Jabanna made sure I was comfortable and my seat mates were great as well. The seating was excellent and as a hearing impaired person they really were great. I will definitely fly JetBlue again. My only problem was at my arriving airport no customer service agent was able to assist me with requesting a refund for the bag upgrade I didn’t utilize."
ALLYSON,Fort Lauderdale  //  Lima,tripadvisor,10/13,positive,"I just want to thanks ALLYSON, it was a pleasure having you there helping us through the check in process.You went the extra mile and beyond. You are great asset to the company.From now on just JetBlue."
Travis Williams,Tampa  //  San Juan,tripadvisor,09/02,negative,My wife and I paid $35 each to move to exit row on the day of the flight 9/28 cause the two rows were empty.However once getting the plane the flight attendant Travis Williams gave the seats to passengers who didn’t pay for the seats.So why pay? Just ask the flight attendants to move you once seated.
"Kennedy, Colleen",Los Angeles  //  New York City,tripadvisor,09/08,positive,"Took the 8 30 pm flight from Los Angeles to KennedySimply put the best most economical 1st/business class for transcontinental flightSpacious seating with a full lie flatbed, food service done uniquely with a nice platter and assortment of salad sandwich and soup , accompanied by dessert which was a delicious mint flavored ice creamAdd filled roll for breakfast with drink and cookieTremendous entertainment selection including live TVThe best of all was the in-flight serviceNice greeting by the cabin attendant ColleenServe choice of drink before takeoff and during flightVery attentive throughoutGoing coast to coast this is the way to fly"
Never,Buffalo  //  Orlando,tripadvisor,09/06,negative,"The trip to Orlando had severe turbulence, the pilot was excellent, had complete control of plane, Never felt there was ever a problem or any issues.The return flight from Orlando to Buffalo wasn't very good. First, delayed and told TV's weren't working, however TV's had been working fine until flight attendant hit a button. Also, we could clearly hear and feel work being performed on the outside of the aircraft.. After take off, we could see out the window by the wing, when the flap on the wing was open, It clearly showed a piece of rubber coming out from under the flap blowing in the wind as the airplane ascended. Notified flight attendant ""Nes"" who took note. Spent the entire flight back through all the turbulence concerned for our safety especially since we didn't feel as confident with the pilot's abilities. He never once spoke to the passengers. Made it back to safely. Buffalo (BUF)crew much nicer, friendlier. Orlando (MCO)crew seem strained. I would fly with JetBlue again but I'm not as confident as I was in their overall performance and safety."
JFK,New York City  //  Aruba,tripadvisor,09/21,negative,"I would normally give Jet Blue a 5 star rating because they provide great, comfortable service. However, on this recent flight, we had major confusion at JFK resulting from having to check our own bags and bring them to the bag handler to be placed on the plane. There appeared to be total confusion, no directions regarding how to place the tags after getting them, no direction where to proceed, no defined lines to give the bag to the baggage handler. Very stressful. Would recommend you arrive earlier than usual at JFK and find a Jet Blue rep to assist you if you have to check a bag. Otherwise, after the bags were checked, we had our usual good flight and service in both directions between JFK and Aruba. Aruba terminal check in was fine."
Brandon,Fort Lauderdale  //  Philadelphia,tripadvisor,09/19,positive,"My first time flying with jet blue was this past weekend coming home from Fort Lauderdale Florida, to Phl airport in Philadelphia. I was at first nervous being I don’t really love to fly to begin with but I didn’t hear much about jet blue in the past. Long story short I was an idiot and beyond happy with my experience. It was the best. The plane itself was great, the inside was amazing and I felt like I was in a luxury top dollar airplane. I had a tv that I could watch basically anything I wanted, I could turn on 3D or 4D navigation to see the location and information about my flight, free WiFi, along with all kinds of charging ports, TONS of legroom, super comfortable seats that reclined, the head rests all have this adjustable pillow thing to cradle your head so if you fall asleep your neck won’t break off from slouching, and the staff was spectacular. I have to pinpoint and recognize one very special team member, Brandon, for making this trip so exceptional. He treated us with such kindness, and spoiled me during the flight. This flight just happened to be my birthday. My boyfriend had told him and he announced it to the entire airplane, I felt so special. He made sure that we were comfortable, taken care of and wasn’t afraid to have friendly conversation. Jet blue needs to show appreciation to its team members and recognize him for his outstanding customer service and just overall great personality. You are lucky to have him jet blue! Thank you Brandon!!!!!!!"
Veronica,Newark  //  San Juan,tripadvisor,09/27,negative,"Pity service at check inI flight very frequently, and at the last minute option I chose to fly Jet Blue. Today 25 Sep 19 at about 03:30 I make my line and when I am called I give my ID. The person at the counter tells me sharply, I don't need your ID what do you need, I tell her that I need to Check my baggage, and then she replies with attitude, I don't even know where you're going, so I proceed to give her my ID for the second time. It is outrageous for a person at the counter to ask those questions and more with an attitude. I am very sorry for the people who will check in with that kind of person. Her name is Veronica and I barely saw it because she used his open jacket and not as supposed. I give Jet Blue 0. To be a “cheap” airline doesn’t mean people doesn't deserve a good service."
JB,San Juan  //  New York City,tripadvisor,09/20,negative,"I cancelled a flight 2 hrs after booking (only 1 seat was left, so I jumped). It didn't work for me so I cancelled. Every normal airline I've dealt with would refund the full amount to the credit card. Not JB: they took a $200 fee and only gave a credit valid for 1 yr on JB. My flight was 6 days out, so < their 7 day limit. They don't tell you this unless you go through pages of fine print. Lost $550.I was satisfied with their flight service in the past, but won't put up with them again."
Saint Martin,Fort Lauderdale  //  St Martin / St Maarten,tripadvisor,09/09,negative,"Booked airfare and hotel through Expedia. My partner and I booked a trip to Saint Martin, he holds a South African passport and checked online to see if he needs a visa to get into the country. After seeing mixed answers we decided the best way to get the answer was to call JetBlue, the representative did not know the answer. Told us to call customs/immigration, they didn’t know either. So, we went to the airport before hand to speak to someone from JetBlue to clear things up and take the necessary measures to make our vacation go smoothly, we were assured he was going to get into the country and the only thing we had to do was check in at the counter instead of the kiosk. We boarded the plane, landed in SXM, only to find out that he did in fact need a visa to gain entry to the island. Customs there said that JetBlue should have known this and not let him on the flight without proper documentation, that they can get fined for this as well. So as soon as we got to SXM, they made us board the same plane and go back to FLL. We now lost out on our vacation, after spending all the money and airfare and accommodations and I took my only vacation week for the year from work. Trying to move past this, and make things right, I called JetBlue but the representative and their supervisor said that it wasn’t their fault and regulations change all the time. Isn’t it their job to keep up with the new regulations? To have their staff trained and competent to handle these situations? I tried to make sure we were prepared and have the proper documents for entry but JetBlue told me we did! If they told me a visa was required I would have made the necessary changes to my travels. And now they are saying that it’s not their fault, and that they cannot give me a refund. Beyond me to believe that they can get fined for this but still tell me that it’s not their fault. Will not be using JetBlue or recommending it to anyone until they make this right. So disappointed by their lack of responsibility for their actions."
R,Atlanta  //  Boston,tripadvisor,09/09,positive,"R/T flights were right on time, staff was friendly, plenty of leg room, free movies, got a great R/T fare...first time flying with JetBlue and was very happy."
Meyers,Fort Lauderdale  //  Nassau,tripadvisor,09/28,positive,"Was scheduled to fly into Nassau on Sunday but due to circumstance we didn't make it back till Tuesday. Every staff person I encountered during these cancellations was 100% professional, courteous and understanding of the individual needs. We gave it a go on Monday morning and almost landed but last minute weather on New Providence diverted us back to Ft. Meyers. Once there they laid out our options for returning home and offered bus transportation back to our point of origin. While I did not take them up on this and headed to Miami for a flight instead the crew and gate personnel went above and beyond in my mind. Will fly again."
JB,Fort Lauderdale  //  Hartford,tripadvisor,09/18,positive,"Took a business trip to MA. As always from FLL to BDL and back the JB employees were outstanding. No need to wait for help, they offered and were friendly and accommodating. During the flight back, it seems they renovated the inside of the plane. All-new seats and interior of plane. The seat was very comfortable and new viewing screens were easy to access."
Logan,Fort Myers  //  Boston,tripadvisor,09/27,positive,"Very convenient to get inexpensive non-stop service from RSW (Fort Myers) to Logan (Boston), even better with JetBlue!! No charge for carry on or seats like on most airlines now. Flights were both on time and service was very courteous."
Dorian,Tampa  //  Boston,tripadvisor,09/11,positive,"Originally we were supposed to fly out of Orlando on a different airline, due to Dorian that flight was cancelled so to keep on schedule we purchased tickets last min on JetBlue. The extra space seat were all they had left but they turned out to be so worth it. The TV kept my nearly 2 year old niece happy in flight and the WiFi available kept all of us adults entertained hand happy. I do have to praise the flight attendants were so kind and helpful to a man sitting next to me who was flying alone with 1 young daughter and an infant."
Kennedy,Newark  //  Fort Myers,tripadvisor,09/12,negative,"I usually try to stay away from Jet Blue when flying thru Newark, but since I was flying back fom Rome, they had a flight to Florida at 5:20pm ..I came arrived at 230 so it was an easy connection..or so I thought. When I arrived I immediately received a text that it was delayed an hour..I was informed it was snot at 1030am..I asked at the check in counter why they are always delayed fom this airport and was told..if you want to leave on time, fly out of Kennedy....seriously. After going thru security, the first thing I see are porta bathrooms lining the corridor...there is one restaurant and ver small, one small counter for other food, almost no place to charge...only available for 6 passengers, not enough seating for passenger waiting...so extremely crowded...the flight was delayed again..the gate agents are screaming over the microphone ...it's a complete nightmare.We left 3hrs late...I paid extra for extra room..but so not worth it...their claim to fame are the snacks they hand out...I rather have good service and forgo the silly snacks. There flight attendants are not responsive or don't care.I will do my best never to fly them between Florida and Newark"
Melisa Who,Boston  //  Fort Lauderdale,tripadvisor,09/04,negative,To day in Logan international airport gate C21 JetBlue employee name Melisa Who was in charge of the flight she was extremely rude and on professional the way she treated me today as a customer she was at the counter when I approach her to ask her why I didn’t have seat assigned when I paid my full fare for three tickets my wife and my son and she told me to sit down raising her voice on me not enough for her she told me if I have a problem I tell her that I will report this to JetBlue I asked her for her employee number and she refused to give it I walk away and I start calling JetBlue customer service I don’t recommend JetBlue nobody today they have 10 delayed flight 😡
Dorian,Newark  //  Orlando,tripadvisor,09/24,positive,"We had to change our flight from Tuesday to Thursday due to hurricane Dorian. I used a JetBlue service rep to make the changes, and he was extremely helpful in working out all the details. JetBlue doesn't have curbside check in at Newark, but once you get inside their staff is there to help you with the check in process. My wife and sister-in-law needed wheel chairs, along with several other people at the same time. The staff worked out getting the chairs for everybody and getting us thru security and down to the gate. They were most helpful, The gate staff got us seated and despite being cautioned by the pilot that we might experience turbulence as we passed by the hurricane, which was along the coast of the Carolinas at that time, we actually had a rather smooth flight. On board service was very good. Our arrival at Orlando went just as smoothly as our departure with help to retrieve our bags and get curbside, My total impression was that JetBlue is one airline that still values its customers. And it's seats still leave room for my legs. This is my go-to carrier whenever they serve my destination."
"Chris, Ilda",Cancun  //  Fort Lauderdale,tripadvisor,09/25,positive,"My wife and I had a round trip recently with JetBlue - Cancún - Ft Lauderdale.It was our first time going with JetBlue and in spite of a four hour flight delay, we left feeling good about this flight (and the return flight, of course, which did not experience a massive delay).A bit thanks to the crew at the check in counter - specifically Ilda in Cancún and Isdelia in Ft Lauderdale, who were so kind to give us emergency row seats, which made the trip more comfortable since we are fairly tall people. These little things make a huge difference for me, since I am flying a lot.The flight to Ft Lauderdale was delayed by 30 minutes due to mechanical issues, and once we boarded it was announced the plane has another mechanical issue, and that it needs to be fixed.Some of the passengers were getting loud and unhappy, but the cabin crew handled everything profesionally and kept a positive attitude, even as we entered our fourth hour of sitting on the tarmac in the airplane. Pilot Chris and flight attendants Mandy and Leonard kept the spirits high, and we were offered unlimited snacks and complimentary drinks once we finally took off.We can't stress enough how their attitude and behavior improved this messy situation. Most people would go mad while sitting four hours in an airplane, waiting for a 90 minute flight, but this crew kept things flowing and kept in line some of the more argumentative passengers.The thing I must point out, is JetBlue contacting us first about our flight - the company reached out first and offered really good refunds for our flight. We were thinking we would need to arm ourselves with patience and stamina and fight through endless customer service, and we were very pleasently surprised that JetBlue thought about it all already and issued us apologies and refunds without question, just for the delay!The crew behavior, their attitude, willingness to help, way of communication and level of proffessionalism are to be taught to other airline companies on how to deal with similar situations. You have got yourself a passenger who will primarily check JetBlue flights for other destinations, even if there is a slightly cheaper option available elsewhare. Why would I go from Disneyland back to regular park swings?Thank you for everything JetBlue!"
"Santo Domingo, San Juan PR",Detroit  //  Santo Domingo,tripadvisor,09/06,negative,Me and my friend had a flight from Detroit to Santo Domingo and it had 1 stop in Boston. The Detroit flight got delayed and therefore we missed our connection flight from Boston to Santo Domingo. We went over to the Just Ask desk and what they first offered us was to take the next flight to San Juan PR and then take another one from PR to RD at 10 am tomorrow. Then they stated we can stay in the airport and wait 10 hours for the next flight to my final destination tomorrow at 8:00 am. We do not know anybody neither in PR or here in Boston. Never ever JetBlue. 👎🏼 Worst customer service.
"Alexis, Chris",Cancun  //  Fort Lauderdale,tripadvisor,09/05,positive,"My husband and I flew a round trip recently with JetBlue - Cancún - Ft Lauderdale. It was our first time going with JetBlue and in spite of a four hour flight delay, we left feeling good about this flight (and the return flight, of course, which did not experience a massive delay, thankfully). I'd like to commend first and foremost the crew at the check in counter - specifically Ilda in Cancún and Isdelia in Ft Lauderdale, who were so kind to give us emergency row seats, which made the trip more comfortable since we are fairly tall people (I'm 178 and my husband is 202 cm). The flight to Ft Lauderdale was delayed by 30 minutes due to mechanical issues, and once we boarded it was announced the plane has another mechanical issue (comms between cockpit and back of cabin) and that it needs to be fixed. It was apparent there was an issue as we could hear an alarm and some of the passengers were getting antsy, but the cabin crew handled everything profesionally and kept a positive attitude, even as we entered our fourth hour of sitting on the tarmac in the airplane. Pilot Chris and flight attendants Mandy and Leonard kept the spirits high, and we were offered unlimited snacks and complimentary drinks once we finally took off. I can't stress enough how their attitude and behavior improved this messy situation. Most people would go bonkers sitting four hours in an airplane, waiting for a 90 minute flight, but this crew kept things flowing and kept in line some of the more argumentative passengers. The emergency seat, as always, had lots of legroom, but from peeking at other people's seats, it seems there's lots of legroom in those seats as well. The high point was definitely JetBlue contacting us first about our flight - the company reached out first and offered really good refunds for our flight. We were thinking we would need to arm ourselves with patience and stamina and fight through endless customer service phone calls, and we were very pleasently surprised that JetBlue thought about it all already and issued us apologies and refunds without question.The return flight was without any issues, smooth, again, the flight attendants were really cool and helpful - especially Alexis who I wished I would've asked for her number! At all rates, we are definitely flying with JetBlue again and we are definitely recommending it to other people, and we're keeping our fingers crossed that they will have more flights going to US from MX because we really just wanna travel with them now all the time :D"
Hurricane Dorian,New York City  //  Los Angeles,tripadvisor,09/27,positive,"We flew into JFK (originally scheduled to fly into Miami) from the Bahamas just before Hurricane Dorian struck. We were lucky to get out in time!It was a much longer flight back to Los Angeles, but the airline made the adjustment for us for a safer way home. We weren't informed, but I was pleased with the decision. I just wish I would've gotten an email. I only knew we were transferring at a different airport when I went to check in the day before.The flight itself was pleasant. The crew was very accommodating. They had DirecTV in-flight and I free wi-fi. Somehow they knew I was flying on my birthday and made an announcement, which was very kind. I guess the crew didn't realize it earlier and said they would've offered me a birthday cocktail. I was fine with it, but as we went to depart the plane the same crew member handed me a bottle of wine and said happy birthday again. It was a very, very kind gesture and I appreciated it greatly."
"Carlos, Lisa",Washington DC  //  San Juan,tripadvisor,09/04,positive,"I will start by giving the biggest compliment and kudos to the flight attendants on my flight today from DCA to Puerto Rico. While in mid flight, one of the passengers had a heart attack and can I just say how well trained Lisa & Carlos are along with the rest of the crew. While I was praying for this poor man’s well being, they were fast in identifying the problem, worked well as a team and their communication was on point. They stayed calm through all this and stabilized the patient. We seem to forget at times while complaining Paying higher prices on air flights, that these flights attendants have a hard job. Although our flight had to do an emergency landing to beautiful Bermuda, it was all worth it in order to save a life. 🙏🏿 At the end, we arrived a couple hours late to PR but nonetheless made our trip just a bit more interesting."
Im,San Diego  //  New York City,tripadvisor,09/21,negative,Im outraged i was charged $150.00 for my luggage 10 pounds over weight.If I would of known this I would have bought an extra carrier on bag but that would be difficult since i have fibromyaglia and cant carry stuff justa back packI had one back pack and 1 check in luggageI am fully disabled with fibromyalgia I can show proof I was not told I could take out 10lbs out so the fee would be zero dollars. I try to dispute this twice with customer service and a supervisor and they wouldn't help with credit or some money back. This is price gouging and not fair. I could understand an extra 50 bux for going ten pounds over weight but $150 was unexceptable especially I upgraded for a free luggage check in. I am disputing this with my credit card company bc this is shameful that Jet Blue has a ridiculous policy like this.
Kitty,Montego Bay  //  New York City,tripadvisor,09/01,positive,We were flying back from Montego Bay and there were situations with the seat assignment. Kitty was super helpful and helped us with the adjustment. Kudos to the great customer service! We will choose JetBlue again because of this great experience!
JB,New York City  //  Providenciales,tripadvisor,09/16,negative,"I tend to use Delta for my travel because they seem to go everywhere I need to go. I recently tried to get tickets to Turks & Caicos and the Delta flights were booked, so I decided to try Jet Blue...well, I tried it, and I did not like it! They do board the back of the plane first, which is just common sense in my book, but the on board movies leave much to be desired. I tend to watch my movies on a plane, so am so happy to catch up with current ones...there were almost no new movies on JB; many documentaries, but that doesn't peak my interest. When we arrived back in NY, the line to get to customs was like a cattle herding...a winding staircase, packed to the gills, which would be a fire hazard in an emergency. Then the baggage retrieval was horrific...there were 3 planes on one belt, and it stopped when the bags filled up the belt...leaving us all to take suitcases off so it would restart! The saving grace was how wonderful the crew was."
DON'T,Fort Lauderdale  //  Kingston,tripadvisor,09/02,negative,"A little pricey but expected due to summer peak travel. Flight was ok but very limited space for carry on luggage. Boarding staff and flight attendants DON'T enforce the 1 up and 1 under so smaller bags get stuffed in overhead bins, some persons put both pieces inside and then there's very little space to put your carry on"
jfk,New York City  //  Aruba,tripadvisor,09/22,positive,"jet blue has many flights per day to aruba, however i take the first direct flight out of jfk, usually land in aruba before noon, we are the first ones through the aruba airport, off to my car rental and on the beach by 1pm. if you book early that one way flight is usually under $250. if you can fly mid week you can find that flight for under $200"
La Guardia,New York City  //  Bogota,tripadvisor,09/07,positive,JetBlue was organized and efficient--passengers were seated on time- no delays. Seating was comfortable and spacious. Flight was early staff made sure passengers were comfortable and they went above and beyond expectations. They had room for luggage you did not have to go through the hassle of checking your bags and waiting in baggage claim- would definitely recommend this airline when traveling. Only downside- wish they had flights from closer airport i.e. La Guardia
Medvedev,Buffalo  //  Orlando,tripadvisor,09/13,positive,"The first time we ever heard of this airline was when our agent booked reasonably good priced tickets on this airline. The online check in only starts 24 hours before the flight and each check in bags cost $30. The online check in process itself was fairly easy; so was the baggage drop in. The flight was decent size with in-flight entertainment (which I did not expect on a ""no frills"" domestic flight), including live sport where I watched Medvedev beat Djokovic at the Cincinnati masters. There were light refreshments and the cabin crew were friendly. Overall it was an enjoyable flight."
Aaron,Orlando  //  Los Angeles,tripadvisor,09/28,positive,I’ve always had a great experience flying on JetBlue so far but Aaron on flight 131 made this trip exceptional! Traveling with three little kids isn’t easy but he helped make it just a little more bearable!:)Thanks again!!
JFK,New York City  //  Long Beach,tripadvisor,09/16,positive,"I have flown Jet Blue numerous times between JFK and California and have never been disappointed. Planes are well-maintained and clean, seats are comfortable, particularly when considering that this is marketed as a ""budget"" airline. Customer service is excellent with personal support by phone when necessary. You are able to purchase food and beverages during the flight and chips, coffee, water, and soda are complimentary. Great prices, great flexibility in managing your trips, and consistently awesome customer service. What's not to love?"
Counter,Washington DC  //  Fort Lauderdale,tripadvisor,09/25,negative,The person that purchased my ticket had made a mistake and had booked me for the following night. The Counter ladies got me on the plane even when we had very little time.
Hurricane Dorian,Fort Lauderdale  //  San Jose,tripadvisor,09/17,positive,"Love JetBlue ... Easy to make reservations on line... If you need to call, very courtesy employees who will make your flight stress free! Had to wait a while on hold but well worth the wait... Upcoming Hurricane Dorian I am sure caused it! The captain we had is a great pilot and the flight attendants courtesy and friendly! Flying with a little snack and drink was like flying in the 60's! No hassles and JetBlue employee helped us with checking in at the kiosk being first time users ... It was easy and expeditious before going to counter!"
San Juan P.R.,New York City  //  Las Vegas,tripadvisor,09/04,positive,I've been flying with JetBlue for years and have had an overall great experience with them. Rarely delayed and always great on board service. Will be flying to San Juan P.R. in a few months and will be upgrading to business class. Looking forward to the next level!
Jim,Portland  //  Long Beach,tripadvisor,09/21,positive,"Had a great flight, Jim and I highly recommend JetBlue's staff, snacks, seating, leg room. The only drawback is we had to use a ramp to board, awkward to drag our carry-on luggage up a fairly steep ramp. We did get to use the standard jetway instead on two instances."
Michael,New York City  //  Tampa,tripadvisor,09/11,positive,"I can’t say enough about Jet Blue and their excellent staff! They were dealing with full flights on both of my recent trips, they were dealing with a different plane being delivered to the gate so the seat configurations didn’t match and they managed to get everyone reassigned quickly and orderly. They even upgraded me from extra legroom to Mint because my seat no longer existed on the new plane. They were dealing with lots of elderly people, someone in a wrong seat. Someone who had not bought a ticket for their baby and was trying to put them in a car seat. Dogs. And then I for the first time in my life, left my tote bag under the seat in front of me and superb flight attendants Michael and Anthony went back for it. I saw these gentlemen help so many elderly passengers on the plane with kindness and respect. I truly wish Jet Blue flew everywhere I need to go!"
Dorian,New York City  //  Aguadilla,tripadvisor,09/20,positive,Considering that hurricane Dorian was still live and wrecking havoc along the east. The pilot advised that we will not be flying near the hurricane to get to BQN. The flight was better than when we fly without any hurricanes and arrived before schedule. JetBlue is my favorite airline for traveling and will continue to use them.
Dorian,Boston  //  Jacksonville,tripadvisor,09/13,positive,One of the pilots went out of his way to help me on board and off! I have recently had two knee replacements. The flight was generally smooth in spite of a lot of major cloud formation due to Dorian. The pilots did a very fine job!
JFK,New York City  //  Las Vegas,tripadvisor,09/05,positive,"JFK is not my favorite airport because of the horrible traffic to get there. The saving grace is in terminal 5, there are many eateries, restaurants and shops to occupied your time. We had an early evening flight to Las Vegas and arrived early to avoid the lines. The security checkin was short and fast, but the flight was delayed - three times! We appreciated the comfortable seats and snacks JetBlue offered. Wished that there were more flights out of Newark."
JB,Newark  //  Fort Lauderdale,tripadvisor,09/14,negative,"Jet Blue has been our airline of choice for quite awhile. The flight was a good one. We did want to purchase sandwiches on-board but were told there was no food available other than snacks as the flight was too short. Hot tip: if your JB flight is short and you want a sandwich or whatever, buy it after you clear security. They are supposed to refund us for the flight back which we had to cancel in order to escape Dorian but I haven't seen it yet although they said we'd receive it sometime next week."
Captains,New York City  //  Las Vegas,tripadvisor,09/16,positive,"I always fly Jet blue if possible. They have the best staff, Captains, Co Captain and flight attendants. Everyone is always friendly, helpful and ready to assist in anyway possible. The flights are always on time or earlier very rareley late. I trust their planes are in great shape."
Stephanie C,Boston  //  Las Vegas,tripadvisor,09/13,positive,Stephanie C went out of her way to explain everything we needed to know about switching flights. It was more like talking to a family friend than an employee of a corporation. Jet Blue must treat their employees well to produce such a patient and helpful person who focused carefully on our situation and offered choices and solutions. The flight are casual and comfortable but what made this flight the best was the human touch. Thank you!
Alladin,West Palm Beach  //  Boston,tripadvisor,09/20,positive,Favorite airline ever! I flight staff rocked ! So worth paying a bit more for extra space. So comfortable and I got see Alladin
JB,Fort Lauderdale  //  Montego Bay,tripadvisor,09/06,positive,"We flew out of Ft. Lauderdale-Hollywood and the check in was smooth. Our flight departed on time. This is my first time flying JB. I was a little nervous due to reviews but this was by far one of my best flights. The plane was nice and clean. The flight itself is very smooth which is always a plus for me being that I don’t like to fly but I do it for convenience. The flight attendants seemed like they were in a hurry but that is to be expected on a 1 hour flight. They have to serve everyone in that small amount of time. I asked for some earplugs to plug into the TV, but they didn’t have any on the cart. So iPhone users, if you want to watch TV on JB, bring regular earplugs. Other than that I have fell in love with JB. While I’m Montego Bay, our flight was delayed twice due to the weather and FLL being closed because of Hurricane Dorian. After the second cancellation we were referred to the 3rd party that we booked through. JB took care of their customers that booked through them and not 3rd party which is to be expected. We flew back through AA, but I was upset that we couldn’t get JB. I will definitely be flying with them again!!!"
Torquemada,Fort Myers  //  Boston,tripadvisor,09/04,negative,"While the seat pitch in Jetblue’s economy cabin remains humane, the seats on its new A321 planes call to mind Torquemada and the torture chamber. The seats seem narrower and shallower and the padding almost non existent. It made for a sore derriere. This is a harbinger of the future, sad to say, as these seats remind me of those on Southwest’s new planes."
Dylan,Boston  //  Los Angeles,tripadvisor,09/04,positive,"Jet Blue has been great, never had travel issues with them (maybe just lucky but I use them frequently) recently had a rough experience with United and wound up stranded in Boston and had to re book with Jet Blue and they turned a terrible experience into a good one. Dylan in particular on flight 987 was super nice and empathetic, great customer service!"
Stephania,New York City  //  Long Beach,tripadvisor,09/10,negative,"I’ve been a JetBlue loyal customer for years and now I’m canceling my rewards credit card and leaving our family pooled points behind.I made a business trip reservation. My schedule changed ten minutes after I booked and I changed my outgoing flight. I was charged a $150 fee but the site told me that I would not be charged because I changed within the first 24 hours.I called, held for half an hour, gave up and used the text option. After going back and forth here’s what I got from the very polite customer service person, Stephania:Because you have already initiated the change, you no longer qualify for the DOT 24-hour fee waiver. Our system will not allow us to issue a refund of that fee.This is ridiculous- I could’ve cancelled my flight and rebooked the whole thing and not been charged and would’ve IF I KNEW THERE WAS GOING TO BE A $150 CHARGE! But since the site said I would not be charged because I made the change within 24 hours I assumed, like it said, that there would be no charge!It’s too bad. I love the planes and fly across the country and to South America multiple times a year- even got the reward card. Now am canceling it all and looking for a new airline."
JFK,Bridgetown  //  New York City,tripadvisor,09/26,negative,The plane was late it was to leave Barbados at 2.15 pm and it left at 4.20pm we didn’t get to JFK until after midnight due to the plane had to refuel at Newark
JFK,New York City  //  Hamilton,tripadvisor,09/15,negative,"WORST EXPERIENCE EVERwill NEVER fly again.Was scheduled to catch the 655pm flight from JFK to BDAOnce arriving at the gate, the attendants said the flight is delayed because they had to clean the plane and do security checks because international flight, so delayed until around 8:30pm.Then the Flight was delayed further until 1230am because they said the plane had actually not arrived. The flight was delayed further until 330am because they could not find a pilot and first officer.We then got notification two more times of delay, 555am, and again at 625am, for reasons unknown.We passengers received at least 4 different excuses for the delays and then no explanation at all.We passengers also went to the help desk after the 2nd or 3rd delay update, to get help as Jetblue quotes they love to help, and they were not helpful at all.I feel that JetBlue felt they can mistreat Bermudians (and any other passengers on board) based on the run around they gave us with this flight.I also feel that JetBlue didn’t want to cancel the flight in order to save money. So they opted to keep “delaying” and keep us “hostage” in the airport. Then make the suggestion, if we cancel our original flight and rebook it, we can’t change back if our original flight flies at whatever time.The lowest points was having physically disabled persons sleeping on cots and then after passengers complaining for about 4 hours, the desk attendants decided to offer food vouchers around 2am!!!Truly a horrible experience!!!!!"
"Dave, Josh, Eric, Chris",Charleston  //  Fort Lauderdale,tripadvisor,09/14,positive,"Got to the Jet Blue counter early on Saturday morning for a flight to Ft Lauderdale. I was transporting two firearms so having never flown JetBlue, I was expecting all kinds of trouble. What a relief I received. I was met by Dave at the counter who was very helpful regarding my weapons. Dave spoke with Eric and Chris who came over and made sure that everything I was doing with the weapons was appropriate and legal to ensure I had no issues with TSA. Everything went flawlessly smooth. This trip was booked by my employer so I asked Dave if he would be kind enough to put me in an aisle seat. When I received my ticket, I was in an aisle seat in row 1. When I boarded the plane, I was amazed at the cleanliness of the plane and the size of the seats. I was greeted by Josh the flight attendant who was very pleasant and professional. We talked quite extensively when he wasn't taking care of passengers and Josh (who resides in Boca Raton) was extremely helpful with advice on places to eat and directions around Ft. Lauderdale where I would be staying. The trip was possibly one of the smoothest and best flights I have ever had and I have flown over two hundred thousand miles on over a dozen airlines. I could not find a single negative thing to say about JetBlue. I will fly JetBlue every opportunity I get from here on out. Thanks to Dave and Josh for making the trip so smooth."
JB Vac,Atlanta  //  Fort Lauderdale,tripadvisor,09/12,negative,"I had planned this trip through JetBlue Vacations many months ago - Was advised via e-mail that my flights were changed and I would be arriving at my final destination the next day at 4 am - this was unacceptable as I was attending a wedding. I called JB Vac and they had no explanation about the change, so I requested that it be moved back - in doing so, I realized, when I got to the airport 45 minutes later that the plane leaving Atlanta was delayed 6 hours and I would miss my connecting flight to Barbados - Very distressing - I called JB again and asked if they could move me to another carrier - they could not do it - I asked if I can cancel this part of the trip so I can get another flight thru another carrier. I got a small credit for the cancellation and called SW and was able to get a seat in a flight arriving early enough in Ft. Lauderdale - the overall additional cost was about $100 - I was very disappointed with JetBlue. However, I am now well aware that I can cancel a part of a flight on the vacation and change it if necessary - if I had known this early on, I would have made some changes in my return from Barbados since I had an event in Orlando FL the day after my arrival home. All the other flights were fine and uneventful."
Jfk,New York City  //  Punta Cana,tripadvisor,09/03,positive,"My flight from Jfk to Punta Cana was a very pleasant one. Everything was fine except for the little tiny seats, almost made for children. They gave out blankets, about 5 and quickly ran out for free and then disposable headphones. Usually in the other airlines they charge for it, at Delta, they gave for free. The airline was very organized and their was one flight attendant whom made my daughter (11years old) wait for an hour for ginger ale that she asked her to give her. Other then that, all was good."
JF Kennedy,New York City  //  Cancun,tripadvisor,08/15,negative,"Horrible airline and high risk landing in Cancun on 8/19/19 , flight departure from JF Kennedy at 7:15 AM. It was a nightmare. My daughter was asleep during this incident and she was shaken so hard during landing, which caused a very bad pain in neck and cervical discs area.WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THESE PILOTS ?. They placed all of us at risk of an accident. AND FLIGHT ATTENDANTS SO RUDE in both flights. We returned 8/26/19 from Cancun at 11:50 AM. Thank God we made it to New York.Jet Blue is THE WORST . Then, they assigned separated seats for my husband and daughter . They were asking $60 per person if we wanted to be together. This company should be out of business."
"Melissa, Hurricane Dorian, Hector",Tampa  //  White Plains,tripadvisor,08/25,positive,"All we can say is Thank you - thank you....!!! We switched our departure flight to NY from Tampa in an effort to avoid Hurricane Dorian. Our original flight was August 31st, but with the impending storm, we felt it was cutting it too close so we sought to leave sooner. Upon arriving to the airport we find out that the Chase booking agent erroneously and nonsensically switched the departure date to September 30th instead of August 30th. So now we are left without flights, Florida is in a state of emergency and with everyone trying to get out we are told that we could possibly be Stuck up to a week - depending on how the storm affects travel. We try every other airline in the Tampa International Airport, including flying out to all airports in and near NY. No luck. Even though some of the flight prices are exceeding $1000 for a normally $300 flight - all flights are taken for days and it is anticipated that travel will cease soon. Hector and Melissa of Jet Blue see our desperation and try to arrange a flight for us out of another Florida airport the next day, which would go to a nearby NY airport. Not convenient, we have no place to stay and our car is located at a different airport in NY. However, it’s better than nothing so we contemplate taking our chances as there seems to be little hope. Feeling defeated, anxious, and uncertain about the near future, we are about to leave the airport when Hector personally reaches out and calls my cell phone to inform me of 2 seats that just came available for that night’s flight, and it’s to the NY airport where we need to be! Talk about Divine Intervention!!! Hector and Melissa are angels! They went out of the way and personally made sure that they helped us secure that flight. The airport was hectic, everyone was trying to get out. They easily could have opted to let it go and not bother following up, but they did, and because of them we are back in NY tonight with our family!!! Thank you Hector and Melissa! Thank you Jet Blue! G-d Bless you guys and praying you and your loved ones all stay safe during this crazy storm!We will never forget this trip - and definitely never forget Hector and Melissa of Jet Blue inTampa! Beyond best customer service - they are sincere, caring, and professional, two gems for sure!"
"I Chamile, Mohammed",San Francisco  //  San Juan,tripadvisor,08/12,negative,"Spent the night at the airport at JFK with my 3 little ones and your employees couldn't be bothered to look up from their personal mobile phones to help us. Also the claim was weather conditions however that makes no sense. The connecting flight managed to get in on time and then leave us stranded. The tarmac was dry and most important, Mohammed told us it was due to construction at the terminals. The people on the phone couldn't help either, said I had to talk to employees at JFK, but like I Chamile was too busy texting and eventually everybody went home and only maintenance walking around. I spent Thousands on those tickets and not even a shred of empathy from your employess.JetBlue. We were left in the middle of the terminal with no place to rest, all restaurants closed so we had no food or water, no blankets, and nobody to help us. Jetblue Doesn't care. They still haven't done anything to show a shred of care."
Harry Potter,New York City  //  Orlando,tripadvisor,08/04,negative,"We booked two JetBlue vacations to Orlando over the past few years -- taking grandchildren to Harry Potter stuff in Universal Studios. The first trip was wonderful, without problems but this August it was very unpleasant and JetBlue Vacations was quite difficult to deal with . When we realized the flight wasn't leaving Sunday night (never informed by JetBlue vacations) I spent hours on the phone, waiting, finally rearranging, to make up for a flight that didn't take off on Sunday night. We finally got a flight Monday morning (JetBlue vacations did arrange that but only after I called them-- they never told me of any problems) and arrived in early afternoon, missing 2/3s of a day and we had to pay for the first night to keep our room (or else we were told we would have no room). Along the way an apparently helpful JetBlue Vacations agent got us a new flight (and told us the seats) but I later discovered we had no seat albeit a very helpful Jet Blue Mosaic agent was able to get us seats -- but interestingly we couldn't get our boarding passes on our apps but the helpful JetBlue Mosaic agent was able to get us registered etc -- thank you JetBlue Mosaic, shame on you JetBlue Vacations. Note that after many complaints and calls, I got a sympathetic agent and I was reimbursed for the extra flight costs I encountered."
Wendy,New York City  //  Nassau,tripadvisor,08/27,negative,"From ny to nassau: waiting TWO HOURS waiting inside the airplane.From Nassau to ny: almost SEVEN hours waiting!!!! If you appreciate your precious time, don’t go with JetBlue. They offered a Wendy’s or Starbucks lunch voucher, but if you are vegetarian or have any food intolerance???? Nothing! Super disorganized and you need to pay $5for a earphone. Unless you have 10 days vacation and you can spend a bunch of hours hanging out on the airport, trying to call JetBlue for 53 minutes waiting on the phone...."
Joanna,Jacksonville  //  Boston,tripadvisor,08/21,negative,We were traveling from Jacksonville home to Boston today when we noticed our stroller had been destroyed upon returning home. When I tried making the claim at baggage claim in Boston they turned me away. I then called customer service and spoke to a very rude woman by the name of Joanna who told me they refuse to reimburse us for a new stroller even though they broke ours. Our wheels on the stroller were damaged and the button to fold down the stroller was completely smashed up. We couldn't even fold it up to put into our car to bring home. Now we have no stroller and JetBlue refused to help us out. This is the last time we will ever fly out of JetBlue. So unacceptable. Thanks a lot for damaging our property then refusing to pay for the damage JetBlue!!! I have pictures and will be sure to plaster them all over the internet so everyone can see that if you choose JetBlue you're taking the risk of getting your stuff damaged and unusable. As you can see from the pictures below I'm not exaggerating on the damage.
JFK,Portland  //  Buffalo,tripadvisor,08/26,positive,"I love JetBlue! The room at the seats is fantastic, the wifi is free, the tv is free, unlimited snacks- awesome! I took off a star because my JFK leg was delayed a bit, then a bit more, then a bit more and it was a JetBlue problem, not a JFK problem... the plane needed to be fixed... I wanted the plane fixed, but honestly they said it was the PA system and it wasn't that fantastic after the 1 hour + delay, so they didn't do that great of a job, if that was the problem at all."
BQN Aguadilla,Aguadilla  //  Orlando,tripadvisor,08/13,positive,"I traveled from Aguadilla ,PR to Orlando MCO airport to my vacations. And then from Orlando MCO airport to BQN Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. In both travels we had a delayed. This kind of situation limits my confidence to consider this airline to my travels eventhough the courtesy and the service is excellent. JetBlue airline should work on this matter a little closer so people that needs to be sure their planned travel is going to be reliable travel with assurance confidence."
Don,Portland  //  Hamilton,tripadvisor,08/07,positive,"I've always flown Delta when possible to rack up those frequent flyer miles, but found such a good deal on Jetblue flying from Portland to Bermuda, that we decided to try them. I like to have my movies on a screen in front of me, like Delta has, but American does not. Jetblue had this. Though we were in economy, the leg room was ample in all the rows. My husband is 6'1"" and is a big man. He had plenty of room. I hate having to ask for drinks, snacks etc because I feel like Oliver Twist begging for more porridge (though the ticket prices don't reflect this!!). Jetblue passes out snacks and drinks, as much as you want (!!!) and then puts everything in a fridge/cupboard in the center of the plane and invites all passengers to help themselves if they'd like another snack or beverage! It's about time an airline realizes that those of us in economy class would like to be treated like human beings as well!! One of the flight attendants, Don, let a little boy help him collect the trash because the child asked if he could. Don said ""of course!"". One passenger tipped this little boy $5 and he accidentally threw it in the trash bag but didn't realize that until he finished his job. Don went through the entire bag to find the $5 bill!!! Where were the surly, exhausted, rude and absent flight attendants?? Not on Jetblue! They were all so friendly and professional. Now that we're hooked, we will try to find Jetblue flights because the service was just so incredible. I do hope it's like this again, because for the first time since 9/11, I ENJOYED flying!!"
Captain,Boston  //  Pittsburgh,tripadvisor,08/27,positive,"I have been flying commercial airlines for at least 55 years now in and on airlines in the U.S.A. both domestic and international. I have to say Jet Blue has always been great and awesome with and to me. They are only one of 3 airlines from the United States I would consider flying if they were flying to where I was going. They are close to what was once the great airlines in the U.S.A.-Pan Am and TWA. For me their customer service has always above and beyond. Yes I am one of their MOSAIC individuals; but, I am also a crew member for a competitor and have always been treated with respect and professionalism from the Flight Attendants and the Gate Agents, especially in Pittsburgh. I have only had one negative experience with them and it involved a Captain who obviously was a new Captain and wanted to prove his position of importance. He was extremely rude and arrogant towards me. That being said I am lucky I do not hold Jet Blue responsible for his actions."
Alvin,Newark  //  San Juan,tripadvisor,08/11,negative,I flew 2 this year with them the first trip was in june there were no delays but I aboard and old plane the engine noise in the cabin was ridiculous I got a headache that last me hours then I go to expedia to take a family trip and the staff at the Newark airport was horrible big ear Alvin on the boarding door was very rude and sarcastic and got upset cus I asked to speak to a supervisor because the flight was supposed to take off at 430 and end up leaving at 7:15 PM cus they did not had a plane crew yess there was no plane crew I lost my rental I had to rent a hotel and I remind u I was flying with 3 kids then call to complain and it was another hassle it will be the last time I used this garbage airline pay extra and go with united trust me u won't regret it remember u get what u pay for
"Tiffany, Michelle",San Diego  //  Hamilton,tripadvisor,08/08,negative,"I made my reservation for this flight about 2 months before my expected travel date. Two weeks before I am supposed to fly out for my best friends wedding, I check my travel via the JetBlue app. The flight showed it was still confirmed, and everything was fine, but then I went to look into my seat assignment and was shocked. The flight was CANCELLED. I never received an email telling me my flight was cancelled and NOWHERE on the app did it tell me it was cancelled until I had to dig for more information.After this I called JetBlue to understand how this happened since I did NOT make any changes to this booking and just wanted to see how this happened and re-book my travel. I called and spoke with Tiffany, and she told me she had no idea how this happened. And then went back and forth with her supervisor Michelle to see if they knew why my reservation was magically cancelled. After about 5 minutes on hold i was told that someone must have logged into my account and cancelled it. Which I did not believe because I never cancelled this flight.I was then told my Tiffany that they would be willing to re-book my flight at the original cost, which sounded okay at first. But I asked how this happened in the first place and what would have happened if I didn't call in today. They told me it was essentially not their fault at all and that I was essentially to blame. I asked if they could give me any sort of upgrade or make this up to me in any way, which Tiffany told me her supervisor would not allow. I asked to speak to her supervisor then.I spoke to Michelle, who took zero accountability for what had happened. I know she did not cancel my booking, but something happened and it was cancelled and she was unwilling to work with me at all. She was extremely rude to me and kept asking for my credit card number, and I refused to give it to her until I had some sort of apology, which she refused to do.I then told Michelle that I have flown over 100 flights in the past few years for work and have never received this type of treatment from any airline employee. She did not care. I then said that I have the option to fly with other airlines, and that I would never fly with JetBlue again. Once again, she did not care about that and told me she could do it at the same rate. I then finally advised her I would not be booking with JetBlue and will be going with a different airline. I then mentioned that I would write a review about this interaction and advise all my colleagues and peers to never fly with JetBlue.Overall, I have never been disregarded as a person like this before. And from a customer service standpoint this is unacceptable. I urge you all to be cautious when dealing with this company as they will never get my business and I encourage nobody else to deal with them in the future."
"Jorge, Savanah",Savannah  //  Boston,tripadvisor,08/19,negative,"While there was no lost luggage, etc. JetBlue required us to sit on the plane in Savanah for 2+ hours due to weather in Boston. We'd have been much more comfortable had we been allowed to de-plane. That and Wi-Fi didn't work on either flight and the promised $ 15 credit never materialized. One caveat, Jorge, the desk agent at Boston on our return flight was a superstar and very courteous. He needs to be the CEO."
JFK,New York City  //  Aruba,tripadvisor,08/03,positive,Staff nice. Prices reasonable for a family of 5. We lost an entire day of our trip with the delay going down (not leaving JFK until well after we should have landed in Aruba.) We also we delayed coming home.
Allyson S.,Fort Lauderdale  //  Newark,tripadvisor,08/28,negative,"Jetblue booked us on a flight for myself and family last minute after Spirit canceled us. They were able to help us out with a friendly smile and caring nature for us desperate travelers. They charged us a very low fare for a last minute emergency booking 2 hours before the flight. I can’t thank two of the agents, Allyson S. and Ryan F. for arranging our booking so last minute going out of their way to find us tickets back home to New Jersey when all the other airlines were all booked!"
Dominic,Orlando  //  New York City,tripadvisor,08/17,positive,I wish to commend Dominic the flight attendant. He had superb manners and made every passenger feel special. Thank you.Hopefully this attitude will continue across the JetBlue airlines
JFK,Burlington  //  Orlando,tripadvisor,08/07,negative,"Day of delays. 930am flight had no crew available, delayed til 1230 to JFK. Original day puts landing in Orlando at 3pm. Delayed in JFK from 2pm til 7. Again, staff had to be flown in. Boarded plane at 7, lift off at 830. Land in Orlando 1030. Full flight, noisy cabin. GoodGod."
Thais,New York City  //  Orlando,tripadvisor,08/14,positive,"I've been flying Jet Blue for years.I like the TV,Movies,and WiFi. Most important the flight are timely and the pilots seem to be among the best. They were one of the last airlines to start charging to check bags.if you get to the gate they will check your bags for free.One change they've made Thais really annoying is that they no longer board the plane from the rear. They need to return to that policy. It would make boarding smoother. All in all I will continue to fly JetBlue. I find them dependable."
Suzanne,Washington DC  //  San Juan,tripadvisor,08/24,positive,Best customer service hands down. Sending a very special Thank You to Suzanne at the DCA Jet Blue counter. The service was absolutely amazing.
JFK,Montego Bay  //  New York City,tripadvisor,08/18,negative,"Typically JetBlue is our go to airline, but JetBlue failed miserably with the experience from Jamaica to JFK. There was very little assistance once you arrived to Sangster Airport. There were multiple lines and no one knew which to go on. It soon became a mass crowd of tired, uniformed and restless travelers. A fist fight almost occurred, with no one intervening. With 6 counters available, only three were manned and the line increasing got longer and longer. The plane arrived late and take off was delayed. Thankfully we checked our carry-ons at the gate because the overheads quickly were consumed.The icing on the cake were the dirty seats (literally can see the grime on the back of the chairs) and the entertainment monitor not working. When the attendant was informed, she told me to find an empty seat knowing the plane was full. Yes, I was to find an empty seat, not her, but me. The flight attendants were caught rolling their eyes and sighing when a traveler made a request. Total lack of customer service - JetBlue do you even have customer service training? I am hoping this was an isolated incident. If not, JetBlue needs to reevaluate their efficiency, productivity and customer service."
Tanya,New York City  //  Fort Lauderdale,tripadvisor,08/24,negative,"This lady at LGA name Tonia or Tanya, not sure which one is correct was so rude, my flight was delayed 6 hours and I wasn't gonna make my connecting flight,I approached her nicely to inquire for help and omg she was extremely rude for no reason, she was also down talking a fellow co worker who was recently new, she stated he was new and in front of people she was embarrassing him and talking about his work ethic but in a unprofessional way,I would rather fly spirit airline and deal with uncomfortable seats then deal with the rude people at JetBlue."
Istambol,Jacksonville  //  New York City,tripadvisor,08/22,negative,"I left from JAX on 7/17 to JFK, flight was deaying every 30 min until cancelled, so I lost the conencted flight to Istambol,It took me 3 days to get to the destination, Coming back to JFK happened the same thing 3 days to get to Jacksonville. the only respond was the weather which was not true. Never ever with them."
Souburbia,New York City  //  Fort Myers,tripadvisor,08/16,negative,"I have used JetBlue in the past, but today I was shocked, August 7th, 2019. Let me start by saying, JetBlue, that you have some of the rudest staff I've met in a long time and might I add, ignorant?JetBlue cancelled a number of flights to Florida due to inclement weather or in my case, ""due to unforeseen events"" without really notifying anyone that the flight had been cancelled. The line for cancelled flights was horrendous, but that was only the tip of the iceberg.One of the JetBlue managers, in his infinite wisdom, decided to break up one of the lines and yelled that ""you can either wait in line with 400 people or 200 people"" meaning the line I was in would be at the back end of the 200 people. He didn't even tell customers where this other imaginary line was. Meanwhile, other agents were trying to discourage customers to stay in line because they didn't want to give any vouchers for hotels or food.JetBlue transferred me to a flight out of Westchester County airport for the following day without even asking if it was acceptable as I was in JFK. Plus, they stuck me in a middle seat and I can't even it change it online without their charging $50 for an extra legroom seat which isn't what I wanted. I just wanted an aisle or window seat.When I approached a JetBlue customer service agent about the possibility of getting a voucher for the shuttle I needed to get to Westchester County and a hotel, she promptly walked away.One of the transport people, while probably not a JetBlue employee, told me to take the AirTrain to Westchester County. Seriously? Souburbia argued with me stating ""Mama, you asked me about flights,"" which I did not! Nor was I her Mama.I've had to take a shuttle to Westchester County and stay at a hotel close to the airport for the possibility of getting on a non-stop flight to Fort Myers tomorrow!Are you going to compensate me JetBlue for the nearly $300 I'm spending on hotel, shuttle van and then another cab to the Westchester County airport? I think not!I won't fly JetBlue again and will tell others the same! Time to get your staff sorted out, JetBlue, and help them understand what true customer service is all about!! You've got a long way to go!!"
God,New York City  //  Port of Spain,tripadvisor,08/21,positive,Smoothest plane ride and landing ever. When was the last time you heard passengers applaud when a plane landed? Well everyone just applauded when we landed with JetBlue on Tuesday.JetBlue still has some ways to God in ensuring that flights depart on time but that’s another review....
JFK,New York City  //  Orlando,tripadvisor,08/11,negative,"My go to domestic airline is JetBlue. The flight left JFK 30 minutes late due to runway repairs and a faulty computer, but the flight landed a mere 4 minutes late. Smooth flight with good service, ample leg room, complimentary Wifi, TV, satellite radio, and movies. Can't be beat."
Holly,Olbia  //  Fort Lauderdale,tripadvisor,08/15,negative,"First off, our flight from FLL to Costa Rica was delayed over and over then undelayed and ended up being an hour late into Costa Rica. The trip home was a nightmare beginning at the airport. I contacted Jetblue at 1-800 Jetblue on August 1st, 2019 to make sure I could fly our Mahi Mahi home on the plane, and how it needed to be packaged to fly. We followed directions to a T. Got to the airport and was told by the agents working there that we could not fly our fish home. Jetblue does not allow flying fish internationally. No where in their rules and regulations does it say that you can’t fly fish home to the USA or Internationally. They confiscated our newly purchased cooler loaded with frozen fish. We were told however that we could fly the empty cooler home for $40.00. REALLY? I contacted Jetblue when I got home and was told by Holly (CRO) that there shouldn’t have been a problem. She would check on it and someone would call me right back. It has been two days with no phone call so I picked up the phone and called back to Jetblue, and received information from a supervisor that we were not allowed to fly the fish back. Costa Rica is a big fishing destination and jetblue doesn’t fly fish back! All other airlines coming out of Costa Rica will fly the fish back. Please know that if you are going to Costa Rica to fish and plan on keeping your fish to bring home , “DO NOT FLY JETBLUE! Pay a little bit more for your ticket and fly either Delta or American Airlines. Very disappointed in airlines teaching rules and regulations to their employees especially those employees handling phone calls about the rules and regulations."
Turks,Los Angeles  //  Providenciales,tripadvisor,08/09,positive,"Great company, great price, great staff, nice planes. Went from Los Angeles to Turks and Caicos with no delays."
JFK,New York City  //  Fort Lauderdale,tripadvisor,08/09,negative,"My flight to JFK from FLL was delayed by three hours and the plane service was terrible. The return flight was delayed by FOUR hours and we were not notified. We found out once we arrived at the airport instead of in the city. The attendants did a terrible job in informing us and the plane kept on getting delayed more and more. I get some simple mistake may have happened but the TERRIBLE service is not acceptable. Four hours of delay and we were not told. The attendants were rude, too. In the end I would never, never in my life recommend BlueJet to someone. The service, attitude of the crew, and efficiency of JetBlue is horrible. Some mistake may have happened but to not be notified and to be responded rudely to is not acceptable. I hope JetBlue changes to a much better system in the future. Nothing is worse than JetBlue."
Alfred Stevens,Orlando  //  Hartford,tripadvisor,08/02,negative,Jet blue is going down hill so bad. Every flight we have been on in last two years is always delayed. What the heck Jet Blue. Used to be th dominant airline. Not anymore for me. Enough is enough. Flight from MCO to BDL delayed 1 hr 20 minutes for no reason. Flight238 on 08/03Joke!!!Not happyAlfred Stevens
Shauna,Santiago de Cuba  //  Charleston,tripadvisor,08/28,negative,"I must share how HORRIBLE our experience was flying with JetBlue. If you are thinking about using his airline, DONT! They are terrible. My husband and I purchased round trip tickets flying us to Cuba on July 13th, and we were to return to Charleston, SC on July 25th with a two hour a layover in Ft. Lauderdale. Before we left Cuba, our flight was delayed 3 hours. Once we got to Ft. Lauderdale, they changed our flight time 3 different times, then eventually cancelling the flight all together with no reasoning of why. We went to the JetBlue service counter to see what was going on. The woman working there looked at my husband who is a Cuban, scoffed at us and went on to tell us with a DISGUSTING attitude that our flight is cancelled and we can't get on another flight until July 27th. TWO DAYS LATER. I asked why and she said because that is all they will offer us. I asked here what she expects us to do until then and she said ""you will figure it out"" I asked to talk with her superior, who gave us the same response, then the superior above her came out and said they can fly us to New York the next day and then to Charleston. Not one time did they offer to put us in a hotel until they found us another flight. They actully refused to help us out at all. And they refused to give us any money back for the EXTREME inconvenience they caused us. LUCKILY American Airlines got us on a flight the next morning and took care of us and got my husband and I home safely. NOT JETBLUE. I will NEVERRRRR fly JetBlue again and I will do everything I can to spread the word of how horrible this airline is. They did nothing to try to make up for the inconvenience, we told them how my husband had work the next day and we MUST get home and to please help us try to figure something out, they refused. This airline is ROBBERY and RACIST.After we arrived home, a few days later a lady name Shauna from the executive offices called me to talk about the experience. I went on to tell her about how horrible the experience was, how nasty the employees treated us, and the $700.00 ticket we had to purchase from American Airlines just to get us home so my husband didn't lose his job. She said all she can say is sorry....sorry? HAHA keep your sorry Shauna how about make up for the cost and inconvenience your horrible airline caused. She said she can't do that. We asked to speak to her higher up, she said that is the CEO and he entrusts her to make al the decisions. She would not let us talk with him. So she made the DECISION to not help correct the issue. Then she got an attitude with my husband over the phone. Well Mr. CEO, if that is who you trust to make your deciions for you...BAD CHOICE BUDDY! She was just as horrible as the employees in the airport they had working for them. Maybe being a rude racist is the only people JetBlue employs! EVERYONE save yourself some misery and AVOID JetBlue, unless you want to get robbed, treated horribly and not delivered to your promised destination, then your at the right place!"
JB,New York City  //  Las Vegas,tripadvisor,08/13,negative,"Was supposed to take flight 711 at 9:25 pm from gate 22 but lo and behold [another] JB flight delayed, by an hour for boarding and didn't take off until around 11-1130. On the aircraft holding a full party; JetBlue asks for volunteers to have their bags go through checked and doesn't even offer vouchers or upgrades to Even More Space. All you get is a condescending ""sorry for the inconvenience"".It's 2019 JetBlue. Get good."
Melissa,Kingston  //  New York City,tripadvisor,07/27,negative,"On Wednesday July 29 I was traveling from Kingston to New York on JetBlue, while in the line waiting to be checked in the crew members on the counters were moving as if time had stopped and also chatting amongst them self. There was only one crew member who stood out and that was Melissa. She was the only one on the counter getting the customers on their way. When it was my turn I waited just so I could go to her counter. I spoke with her and she was so welcoming. I told her because of her I will be flying with Jetblue again."
rain RIAN,Boston  //  Dubai,tripadvisor,00/06,negative,me and my family were looking forward to Dubai and when we boarded JetBlue I was relaxed but then it had a delay and then we had to wait one hour and thirty minutes for rain RIAN and then when we reached Boston to go to Dubai they made our stroller come like one hour after we came of and then we got late for our flight.DO NOT BOARD JETBLUE.
💕💕💕💕💕,New York City  //  Las Vegas,tripadvisor,07/26,positive,Jet Blue has been one of my favorite airlines for many years. I feel that they go above and beyond to keep their customers HAPPY! THANK YOU JETBLUE!💕💕💕💕💕
quickly.My,New York City  //  Orlando,tripadvisor,07/11,positive,"Jet Blue has been one of my favorite airlines for many years. I fill that they go above and beyond, one time years ago I had a issue that was addressed quickly.My family and I do travel to Panama sometimes and I wished they flew there"
Cannot,Long Beach  //  Oakland,tripadvisor,07/25,negative,"4 hour delay for a 45 minute flight. this is the worst airline around. requested for them to delete all my account information and they have failed to comply with California Privacy Policy rights. They have not returned my emails requesting where my personal information has been sold off to. Cannot trust JetBlue, horrible airline and personnel."
Blue,Orlando  //  Boston,tripadvisor,07/04,positive,"Had a pretty new plane with cell charges,touch screen tv’s and very comfey seats. Always feel safe with Blue and there pilots and crew members."
"Justin Vasquez, Christina",Atlanta  //  Orlando,tripadvisor,07/10,negative,I purchased my tickets through Priceline but there was no fine print on reserving seats but that they can't be changed. I wasn't able to check in until 24 hours before. Once I checked in I notice they had my family separate in 3 completely different seats. My husband and I have a 7 year old and he was going to.be seated with a random stranger. I called 1-800-jetblue to speak with customer service about this but Christina said she could not do anything amd I should have called to reserve the seat before or I can pay $25 extra dollars per person to sit together with my family. When I got to the airport I spoke with the person as services at my terminal D3 and Justin Vasquez so quick and helpful. He was able to get our seats together. He was a blessing in an already upsetting morning.
Matt,Las Vegas  //  Long Beach,tripadvisor,07/03,negative,"Worst flight experience of my life, after my flight being delayed 3 times and a gate change I finally boarded my flight. Driving around on the tar Matt for over an hour the pilot decided we are unable to take off.. then we sit there in the plane with no air conditioning or no idea on what is happening for another 30 minutes to be told we are unable to fly. No refund is offered only the option of waiting 2 hours for possibly another flight at 11:45 (midnight) when asking the flight attendant if I’m able to cancel my flight and get my baggage they wouldn’t allow It, they told me I have to collect them in Long Beach as they were not unpacking the luggage from the aircraft. This stopped me from any chance of catching another flight, thanks to JetBlue I missed my ride from longbeach to Lax for my connecting flight home to Australia. Will never be flying with this airline again if I could give minus 10 stars I would."
Saint Martin,Fort Lauderdale  //  St Martin / St Maarten,tripadvisor,07/17,positive,"We booked this trip from Fort Lauderdale to Saint Martin for our honeymoon. The trip was nice, no issues. When you get to Saint Martin you deplane on the runway and they take you to the gate by a bus. The staff was friendly and the ride was smooth. The only improvement that would be nice was the leg room. My husband (6 feet tall) paid for extra leg space and it was almost unnoticeable when you tried to compare it to the other rows. That was a bit of a disappointment. As always though JetBlue had the nice snacks and little TVs."
JFK,Denver  //  New York City,tripadvisor,07/01,negative,"""Mechanical delay - for over 12 hours - they recooked me on a redeye flight 12 hours later, meaning I missed my connection to Doha, meaning I missed my first night and day in Doha and no reimbursement for the hotel from JetBlue?AND - they gave me middle seats on both rebooked flights - where is the value for my money? I bought these tickets three months prior and had isle seats that I lost.Lesson: don't fly on airlines that have very few flights between airports - JetBlue has 2 between Denver and JFK."
JFK,Charlotte  //  Portland,tripadvisor,07/14,negative,"Booked a flight three weeks prior to today. Leaving Thursday the 25 10pm Left north Carolina a little behind schedule, no big deal. Got to JFK and there was a layover. Ok cool not just the only layover 3 other changes after that. Then they canceled the flight completely. Called the jet blue customer service line, wait time was over 25 minutes on the phone on hold for two hours to get nothing. Now they want to charge me another 400+ to get back to north Carolina. Absolutely infuriating how this company operates. Terrible, terrible, terrible and will never be flying jet blue again. Had to cancel all the plans I did make because the next flight they did have was two days later on the 27th which was a Saturday. Completely displeased. Never again will I use this company. Steer clear from jet blue. If I could rate them 0 stars all the way i would they are but I can only go as low as 1...."
Clark Kent,Orlando  //  Washington DC,tripadvisor,07/20,negative,"My sister and I were on flight 824 from Orlando to Washington DC on July 24th. Our flight was 2 hours late and they changed gates on us twice. All passengers were quite upset. Then we experienced Clark, our flight attendant. He was our Clark Kent-our Superman. Clark went down everyaisle and apologized for the tardiness. He also asked what he could do to make the trip more enjoyable. By the time the flight was over, everyone was in a good mood. He turned a bad experience, into a good experience.I will always take JetBlue, even if I have to pay more sometimes. Service is important to me and Clark epitomized what good service is about.GO JetBlue!!!!!"
JFK,New York City  //  San Jose,tripadvisor,07/26,negative,"Previous flight arrived to JFK, airline representatives informed to expect delay with taking off due to issues with brakes.Gate agents were rude and didn't want to answer to any questions.1,5 hours later they notified the issue with brakes was resolved, and check in started. However, during landing in SJC captain informed about the same issues with brakes and circled around the airport for 20-30 minutes.Luckily landing was without issues.How is that possible to consider brakes ""fixed"" and get them broken during the next flight?The worst airline and it was my last time I flew with Jetblue."
Jeyblue,Fort Lauderdale  //  New York City,tripadvisor,07/16,negative,Not the first time that Jetblue canceled flights to fulfill others.Same excuse over and over...weather delays in NY! Well tracking flights from Miami to any NY airports at the same time and guess what no delays...surprising!We had expected such issue as we faced it a year earlier; so we shorted our trip in case of delays and unfortunately end up to be right.Will never fly again with Jeyblue as it cost us more and more money each time to schedule and plan vacations.
"St Thomas, Neward",Newark  //  St. Thomas,tripadvisor,07/06,positive,"We flew from Newark to St Thomas with a 2 hrs layover in San Juan. It was roughly 3.5 from Neward to San Juan, 13 minutes from San Juan to St Thomas. One thing that stands out is the amount of legroom on a JetBlue flight compared to other airlines."
JFK,Aruba  //  Hartford,tripadvisor,07/15,positive,"We always use Jet Blue from JFK to Aruba to take advantage of the excellent non-stop service. We flew from New York on July 6 and were scheduled to return on July24. A medical emergency occurred at home and we were forced to get on the next flight(s) available, back to Connecticut. The agent on the phone was amazing. She got us scheduled for a return the next day, connecting in Florida. We paid the fees for cancelling as well as the price difference for the new flights and she sent me the forms to ask for a waiver. I filled out the information and within a few days, Jet Blue deposited both the fees and price difference in our Travel Bank.We have that money available for one year from today on any booking through Jet Blue directly.Jet Blue truly is an airline with heart and compassion! We will continue to use them as long as they fly to our destinations!"
JDPower,Los Angeles  //  Boston,tripadvisor,07/09,positive,"I really enjoy JetBlue Mint.The cabin was clean, the crew was super friendly, the seats and entertainment are great.I have paid so much more for first class on other airlines that has not been 50% as good.Alaska “ First Class” on the same route on their new 737s is a joke. It’s business maybe.And Alaska touts some JDPower. It’s laughable. Is it them vs Spirit Air 1st class.I will keep flying Mint."
Pilate,Boston  //  Nashville,tripadvisor,07/22,negative,"I've only flown JetBlue once and it was a terrible experience!Props to the poor employees working the counter at our gate that handled a bad situation as nicely as possible.In short, 9hr delay that went down like this with hourly announcements of how the situation was worsening....1) airplane shows up 1.5hrs late just because2) maintenance check revealed something that had to be fixed, a couple more hours delayed.....3) now that maintenance is done, we need to send our Pilate away, he's worked too long. We're only now realizing this and calling in a new Pilate. A few more hours delayed.4) Our new Pilate is arriving, but now our flight crew has worked too long and we're sending them away. Another delay.5) only because JetBlue is cancelling other flights is a flight crew available now.You can go home at 3am instead of 6:30pm, 9 hours late! They are supposedly going to give me a voucher or something, but yet to have received it.........Some things can't be helped, but half of this could have been helped with a bare minimum of foresight and management."
JFK,New York City  //  Grenada,tripadvisor,07/26,positive,"My wife and I flew Jet Blue from JFK to Grenada and back which was a direct flight. Great flight, attentive flight attendants. On time flight, 4 hrs and 10 minutes. We purchased even more sitting, which was wonderflul;_________________________"
Aymen,Detroit  //  Boston,tripadvisor,07/16,positive,"There was this man named Aymen, who was so wonderful, he helped my group and I, when we were so confused and didn’t know what to do when there was a booking error. He did an amazing job and made the whole process so much easier. I would totally recommend this airline."
Myers,White Plains  //  Fort Myers,tripadvisor,07/23,negative,Flight delayed 30 minutes then forced to walk to a different gate no chairs got on plane all power went out forced to sit for 30minutes no a/c no lites finally took off circled Ft Myers for 30minutes landed and told lightning strike forced us to sit in plane another 30 minutes of course we had to wait 20 minutes for our luggage which arrived soaked guess who is not flying again
Thomas,St. Thomas  //  Fort Lauderdale,tripadvisor,07/12,negative,The worst customer service I’ve ever experienced in my life. All of the flights I have taken with them have been delayed and our first one to get home was delayed 12 hours leading us to miss 2 other connecting flights. No help was offered and no one would look at us when we asked for help in st Thomas and now I’m Fort Lauderdale. On top of all of this our bags have been lost and they won’t provide any compensation or help period. Horrible trash garbage customer service figure your stuff out
Shavon,Hamilton  //  New York City,tripadvisor,07/10,negative,"We boarded the flight and sat in 13 A/B There were three seats in our row and three seats behind us. Behind us was a family of four that was tucked into three seats. If I am not mistaken there are some regulations about four people, two adults and two children, placed in three seats I don’t know if it’s the FAA or the TSA or the NTSB, but there must be some rule about that somewhere. The two children cried and screamed for the 90 minute flight from Bermuda to New York. I summoned the flight attendant and asked her to switch to another row and she would only see us one row behind the people with the children, which was not adequate. I explained that there was another row two rows up that was completely empty and please arrange for us to sit there. She did not and her response was those seats were more expensive and if I set you there I would have to explain to other people why. The reason why was because they were kicking and screaming children behind us for 90 minutes. I said that was unacceptable and she then called Shavon, The head cabin attendant. I explained that we were uncomfortable with the kicking and screaming, and she explained that even though there was an empty row, there was nothing she could do about it. I explained to her that this was a very poor customer service and she offered to buy me a drink on board the flight to which I declined. The flight was the most miserable flight I have ever taken The head cabin attendant. I explained that we were uncomfortable with the kicking and screaming, and she explained that even though there was an empty row, there was nothing she could do about it. I explained to her that this was very poor customer service and she offered to buy me a drink on board the flight to which I declined. The flight was the most miserable flight I have ever taken In my 50 years of flying and These were the most discourteous flight attendants that I have ever dealt with.I intend to let JetBlue know about this directly. I am sure that the flight crew had the capability to put us in a quieter location, but For some reason they chose to laugh about the incident to themselves. The first photo is the empty row two rows up from us on the right, real 11 and the second photo shows two adults in the seats behind us of which there were also two children."
Gabriella,New York City  //  San Francisco,tripadvisor,07/24,positive,"I tried 2 other domestic airlines few years back (sfo - las, las- sfo) so i was expecting another just ordinary flight in an ordinary airline away from my home country.1. My booking with jetblue via expedia was fast.2. Since booked via 3rd party, i need to secure my seat. I emailed jetblue, got assisted by Ms Gabriella . She was so kind to assign my and hisband seats besides each other than the original apart from each other (just had hysterectomy and i dont want to be far from him3. Jetblue is the only airline T5 caters in JFK, you just feel like youre all family even if you dont know each other.4. Boarding was organized5. FA kind , gave me another chips6. seats are comfy, leg space wide considering its economy seat and clean7. Chips, drinks , wifi, tv are free. You pay for blanket, earbuds, other food and pillowUnexpectedly good airline, made my trip nicer."
"Sharon Evans # 51287 in Corporate, Rodger, Ernest, Jamie",Orlando  //  New York City,tripadvisor,07/01,negative,"Absolutely the worst airline you can fly with!!!! They are getting worse and worse at being able to deal with people and they are overbooking their schedule. Representatives from JETBLUE Steven, Rodger, Jamie, Bleu, Ernest have all giving my family different answers. We’ve been sitting in this airport for over 11 hours and all they gave was a bag of chips and a bottle of water. To end it off the JETBLUE automated phone system just decided to book us and land us somewhere else without even asking us?!?! What is that about! Called CORPORATE OFFICE just spoke to Sharon Evans # 51287 in Corporate and she have the most RIDICULOUS answer I’ve ever heard!! To everyone out there, LETS ALL FLY WITH SOMEONE ELSE!!! JetBlue is falling apart!!"
JFK,Mexico City  //  New York City,tripadvisor,07/23,negative,"I made an order in February 2019 for a flight from Cancun to JFK.Flight to August, May (3 months after the reservation was made and paid) I received a cancellation notice and they offer me an alternative flight: non-direct and with a high gift.I asked to cancel the flight and get a full refund.Until today - two months after the cancellation. I have not received a refund yet.Not to approach them, and not to book them at all.A nightmare that never ends ...Taking money quickly and returning the money takes them a million years.My recommendation, really not to order from them and will not help you if you send emails."
First Class Hawaiian,Boston  //  Fort Myers,tripadvisor,07/25,negative,"We avoid flying Jetblue because of the consistent poor service with wheelchair assistance. We purchased First Class Hawaiian air tickets from Honolulu to Fort Myers. We were disappointed to find that the Boston to Fort Myers leg was on Jetblue. We sat in the Lounge in Boston for three hours waiting for our connecting flight. As we have experienced in the past, the commotion started when we asked the attendant in the lounge to remind the wheelchair service that we needed assistance and please come a half hour before the flight time because it was a distance to the gate. She made three calls and still no one came. The Lounge attendant left the lounge to roam the hall and looked for someone to help me get my 87 year old husband to the gate. I walked over to two different nearby Jetblue gate attendants to try to get assistance. When someone finally showed up, the person had to run with my husband's wheelchair to make the plane. When the attendant at the Boston gate saw us, she ran to help the other attendant and we made it on the plane. The whole ordeal was upsetting to both my husband and I. This is not the first time with a Jetblue flight. The in-flight entertainment did not work either. It did not matter as by the time I got on the plane I was in no mood for a movie."
JFK,Las Vegas  //  Cancun,tripadvisor,07/18,negative,JetBlue has been declining in service. They tend to blame everything on weather and feel no reason to be empathetic or apologetic about the situation at hand. JFK staff was less than concerned and not helpful often having a poor attitude. I will not want to take any future flights as there is a better route from las to Cancun and better serviced airlines!!
JFK,Buffalo  //  Orlando,tripadvisor,07/14,negative,"They have better legroom than most. Staff is helpful and friendly. They should follow ADA guidelines and have Braille signs on the bathrooms and also Braille signs on the seat numbers. Also - 2 sizes of the earphones .... the one I purchased were too large for my ear canal and hurt.I just tried to check-in for another flight to JFK. I couldn't check in on line and their ""help"" was no help at all.I feel like I was punished for purchasing the tickets months earlier for over $300 when the current prices are less than $100! Next time I will just drive to Long Island."
Erica,Tampa  //  Newark,tripadvisor,07/28,negative,The flight was fine but there were some issues with two of the flight attendants. Particularly Bre and Erica. They placed their luggage and food supplies in my overhead compartment and refused to move them and demanded I move mine.
Ryan,Orlando  //  Tashkent,tripadvisor,07/12,positive,"Thank you Ryan at the check in you made our flight better, he is very friendly and helpful we loved your service"
Gates,Orlando  //  New York City,tripadvisor,07/17,negative,"We booked our flight with Jet Blue as a connecting flight to JFK, in order to fly from there to Russia by Aeroflot airlines.We came to the airport 1.5 hour before flight (couldn't register at the auto check machine, so have to go through the desk).Being the 4 customer in line we've waited for 45 min to get to them.By the time we stand in front of them-they closed our Gates and didn't try accommodate us with other flight, or try to help us anyhow.I should say, while waiting, these representatives couldn't work any slower than they were. Showed absolute A NON CARING ATTITUDE.HAD ONLY TWO REPRESENTATIVES AT THE DESK, while a line of people been waiting for them.I've asked twice to call someone else to help make the check in process any faster (instead I've got a Lecture on why we didn't arrive to the airport at Least 2 hours before the flight, vs our 1.5....??Also most of the representative barely spoke any English.Had to cancel the whole INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT and return back homeWILL NEVER NEVER NEVER FLY WITH JET BLUE, NO MATTER HOW CONVINIENT OR ATTRACTIVE THEIR PRICING WILL BE"
"Myers, JFK",Burlington  //  Fort Myers,tripadvisor,07/14,positive,"Excellent flight. We flew into Ft. Myers to visit my husband's cousin in Venice. We drove up to visit my cousin in Bradenton and flew out of Tampa for home. Because we live in VT, we always have to pass through JFK. We fly jetBlue all the time. On our return flight we take advantage of the lay-over time (JFK to BTV) to have dinner at Deep Blue. It's a great Sushi restaurant!We currently have reservations for Cancun in October. Can't wait."
JFK,Boston  //  Newark,tripadvisor,07/05,negative,"I know the weather was a huge factor, but, the way jet blue went about it was terrible. 2 cancelled flights, a rebooking from Worcester to JFK. What? No thank you, Boston to Newark. Now get me there. Finally 2 days later. and then there was a 1/2 delay. HaHaHa Joke is on me. Thank you jet blue for nothing. I want a refund."
"Little, Floridians",Fort Lauderdale  //  Buffalo,tripadvisor,07/02,positive,Always fly Jet Blue;There seats are bigger than other airlines..The staff(in the airport and on the plane)is fantastic.Wish they had more direct flights to my location but know it’s a business and they have to do what they think isprofitable.But if they are listening it would be great if the direct flight was a Little later(am flying back in October at 6AM)Am so glad they do fly from buffalo to Floridians don’t have to deal with the budget airlines that are less than great(Spirit;Frontier;Southwest)
Vanessa,San Francisco  //  New York City,tripadvisor,07/21,positive,"The ground crew, Vanessa, at San Francisco Airport is courteous, friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating to questions. She was far better than the ground crew at Help Kiosk in JFK, N.Y.The flight was smooth and arrived before schedule. The flight crew were friendly and helpful."
JFK,New York City  //  Albuquerque,tripadvisor,07/16,positive,I am a nervous flyer but felt pretty secure with Jet Blue. Plane was clean staff was kind. JFK is chaos and dirty with unfriendly employees HOWEVER any JET BLUE employee we spoke with was nice. I will fly with them again. We purchased seats due to the fact there was three seats not together. The seats we purchased had great leg room.
Myers,Fort Myers  //  Newark,tripadvisor,07/13,negative,"Was stuck in fort myers for 6 plus hours due to flight delays....I understand that the airline has no control over the weather, but what they do have control over is communication....our flight from fort myers was delayed due to the fact that it was originally delayed from Orlando to Newark the night before such that the 5:30 am flight from Newark to ft. Myers was delayed. All due to weather in Orlando...we did not receive notice of our delay until 5:30 am the morning of our flight...if jet blue knew they were delaying the Orlando flight and the resultant trickle down impact, why not send notification the night before...and then our flight was further delayed due to the fact jet blue could not find a crew due to the fact the original crew had flown over their allotted hours...again if you knew this the day before take the necessary steps then...to top it off...no announcement from JetBlue as to why and even the delays themselves at the airport we only found out by checking the departure board...very poor"
JB,West Palm Beach  //  Newark,tripadvisor,07/25,negative,"So I fly this leg frequently. And I switch between JetBlue and United mostly because of the schedule. JB only has a few flights on this route while United has more. In the past I would always check jb first and settle for United. For the past 18 months though it’s the other way around. It’s like JB forgot how to run an airline? Always late always oversold. Plane packed with an angry crowd. Yea the TVs help and once you take off they are ok but you get the feeling though even the flight attendants are pissed off. They can’t wait to get done. Sure everyone is on edge. Today I had a flight scheduled for 5pm we took off after 9pm. I had an exit row seat, even more seat which of course I paid .... even more. But it was ok. They’ve refurbished the interior new seats new TVs outlets for your iPhone. Good. Service good. Just the damn delay. The pilot said it was due to a mechanical issue. Great did he have to say that? Now being as neurotic as I am I’m wondering what kind of shape the plane is really in??? How many miles on this thing? Who’s working on it? Mr good wrench or jiffy lube?? Anyway it all turned out ok bags cane off quick. Terminal A at Newark though is still a dive. Meanwhile terminal C for United is like the mall of America. Who’s making these decisions? JetBlue was a dream come true when it came in the scene. They were putting the humanity back into air travel they used to say. I think since they fired the founder, they went back in that. I can picture the discussion “hey we need to pick up on the profits and back off on the humanity..... ok people?? “I hope they figure it out because right now I’ll fly United unless I have no choice to fly JetBlue. I hate saying that. It really gives me the blues."

Mom,Fort Lauderdale  //  New York City,tripadvisor,07/05,negative,"Traveling to NYC to celebrate my Mom’s 104th birthday. Scheduled for the first flight out and I was delayed for 8 hours!At first we had no information as to why? But after a few requests for answers we finally were told the truth. No planes available to substitute for our plane that was stuck in nyc. Then after 4 hours we were give snacks then after 7hours at the terminal we were finally given vouchers for food.To my delight we were also credited $150, for our inconvenience, to use toward on our next trip.Thank you"
Flight Crew,Long Beach  //  Austin,tripadvisor,07/04,positive,"Everything about fight from booking to deplaning was smooth and above average. Flight Crew friendly and helpful, snacks above average, beverage service was offered twice in flight. Plane clean and plenty of legroom."
Maurice,New York City  //  Chicago,tripadvisor,07/17,positive,I was very pleased with my flight because of the outstanding customer service Maurice provided to me. He was able to assist me with an emergency that came up and I am grateful for his ability to go out of his way to help. He gets a 10 out of 10. The plane gets a 9 because it was missing the items in the seat back such as the emergency card and info on snacks ect. Not too much of a big deal but someone may want to see them and not have them. Also my chair wasn’t working as it should. But I still enjoy flying JetBlue.
Captain,Fort Lauderdale  //  Aruba,tripadvisor,07/18,positive,"Very pleasent personal . They help from check in till landing at airport .had movies , had unlimited snacks on flight .Captain keep passengers updated as to weather time of arrival this was true on the round trip flights"
Love,Long Beach  //  Fort Lauderdale,tripadvisor,07/06,positive,"I love to take Jet Blue any time I can. Going to and form Long Beach, CA- easy in and out and only 10 minutes from home. Love having the extra leg room compared to other airlines where you need to pay more to get more space. Love also having my own personal tv to watch whatever I want. Jet Blue is the best."
JFK,Austin  //  New York City,tripadvisor,07/13,negative,I always try to fly JetBlue because flightsY are direct to JFK and are on time. I do pay more for more leg room. It makes a big difference getting in and out of the row. The attendants do their job s efficiently but are not that friendly. I don’t really care about that. All in all I get to my destination on time and comfortably.
"JFK, Robin Hayes",Fort Lauderdale  //  New York City,tripadvisor,07/18,negative,"Flight 502 at 9:30 AM to JFK was cancelled due to mechanical problems. We then rebooked a flight to EWR, leaving at 1:55PM.Due to weather in Newark the flight was delayed. We finally left at 4:50PM. Customer Service was very rude and and not helpful. They did not offer any food or drinks. I wrote to CEO Robin Hayes, but he ignored me."
"Mark, Rhonda Julie",Las Vegas  //  New York City,tripadvisor,07/10,negative,Our flight from Las Vegas to JFK was delayed by 2 hours we were told on arrival at the airport.We told the officials that we had a connectioning flight SAA to Johannesburg South Africa from JFK.They shrugged and said to arrange at JFK as it was out of their hands.Long story short....we indeed missed our flights home.We were given tickets for the following day BUT...had to find 1 night's accomodation in NYC at our own expense.I have emailed JetBlue immediately after our return 21st June and no response to date.Mark and Rhonda Julie
