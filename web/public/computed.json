It was supposed to be a nonstop flight arriving at JFK at 910 pm. At the gate in POS we were told the plane would need to make a stop in Fort Lauderdale for fuel. This caused a lot of confusion and concern for passengers- why did the plane not have enough fuel? Why were we flying on a plane that was not properly fueled? We boarded the plane and the pilot informed us that the plane was due for some maintenance and today was the expiration date for required maintanence. He also stated that the parts were not available in NY which is why the plane needed to go to FLL. This caused a lot of concern for passengers as to why Jetblue did not complete required maintanence prior to the expiration and why we were flying a plane that was not in the appropriate condition. Passengers were worried and confused especially given recent plane crashes. We made it to FLL around 820PM and went through customs, had to recheck our bags and get new boarding passes. Our boarding passes said the flight would leave at 1130 PM. There was no gate number on the tickets and the airport boards displayed an 845 departure time. Upon arriving at the gate we were told they were going to try to board earlier than the intended time. We finally boarded around 11pm and were ready for take off until the pilot once again informed us that there was an error showing up that needed to be checked. While we waited as the crew checked, we were told the plane had no food and they were not allowed to serve any beverages besides water. They said all the food places in the terminal were closed. Around 1215am the plane finally left the gate but ended up sitting in place until around 1am when the pilot told us we needed to return to the gate and deplane bc of a mechanical issue. We are all now sitting at the gate in fort lauderdale. We cant step out bc tsa is closed and we wont be able to get back in. Our new departure time is estimated to be around 5 am while we wait for a new plane and flight crew. We cant get anything from our bags that were checked in. We asked for a hotel for the night but the attendants have informed us they are all booked. Many individuals have work in the morning and need to call out or start late because of this issue. How is Jetblue going to fix that? This situation is unacceptable. We are all extremely disappointed by jetblue and their communication and decision making during this situation. By not keeping your planes up to the appropriate standards you have caused distress for all of the passengers of flight 1818. We felt unsafe from the time we left port of Spain and reboarded the plane in FLL. I have always trusted jetblue and chosen them even when prices are higher. They have to reevaluate their priorities and put their customers first. I hope you will put customers first and handle any situations better in the future.

With much difficulty we managed to make it home, frazzled but in one piece. At home we completed the paperwork to receive reimbursement for this very expensive stroller.

I even paid more for extra legroom seats but still could not be seated together. I was told that typically passengers will move to accommodate families with young children and that I should check at the gate.

The flight was horrible whether or not we were seated together but I do believe that sitting together may have helped ease my children's worries even if only slightly. There was another young boy on our flight that had a severe panic attack due to the amount of turbulence. It was really a very bad flight and what was most frustrating was that the the pilot nor the flight attendants gave us any information as to what was happening, whether it was normal and how long we could expect the turbulence to continue. There were no updates or announcements whatsoever. Upon returning from my trip I called Jetblue to discuss this matter and I was told there was nothing that could be done. That if it was deemed a bad enough flight that I would hear from a Jetblue representative. That never happened.

Got to the gate, what was the reason I asked, Oh, we have mechanical issue. Better to have a working function plan than not I say to myself. Then another announcement, the flight as been delayed until further announcement. Flight didn't pass inspection. OK, my response to her was, didn't they not know about this flight going out. Of course she misspoke, well the pilot is not here as of yet. But yet we have mechanical issues and there was not plane to begin with.

Told us to call customs/immigration, they didn\u2019t know either. So, we went to the airport before hand to speak to someone from JetBlue to clear things up and take the necessary measures to make our vacation go smoothly, we were assured he was going to get into the country and the only thing we had to do was check in at the counter instead of the kiosk. We boarded the plane, landed in SXM, only to find out that he did in fact need a visa to gain entry to the island. Customs there said that JetBlue should have known this and not let him on the flight without proper documentation, that they can get fined for this as well. So as soon as we got to SXM, they made us board the same plane and go back to FLL. We now lost out on our vacation, after spending all the money and airfare and accommodations and I took my only vacation week for the year from work. Trying to move past this, and make things right, I called JetBlue but the representative and their supervisor said that it wasn\u2019t their fault and regulations change all the time. Isn\u2019t it their job to keep up with the new regulations? To have their staff trained and competent to handle these situations?

My wife and sister-in-law needed wheel chairs, along with several other people at the same time. The staff worked out getting the chairs for everybody and getting us thru security and down to the gate. They were most helpful, The gate staff got us seated and despite being cautioned by the pilot that we might experience turbulence as we passed by the hurricane, which was along the coast of the Carolinas at that time, we actually had a rather smooth flight. On board service was very good. Our arrival at Orlando went just as smoothly as our departure with help to retrieve our bags and get curbside, My total impression was that JetBlue is one airline that still values its customers.

The representative didn't seem to care at all on the other hand.\n\nI have learnt over the past few months that most airlines in the US are very unreliable when it comes to scheduling; there is always a high potential of having my plans messed up because someone there didn't do their job. Airlines have to be held accountable for their mistakes, and they have to be better prepared for unforeseen changes (yes; like weather being unfavorable). Passengers having to spend a night in the airport or paying hundreds of dollars for a hotel because of flight cancellation should not be OK. The fares collected are not trivial, and a good part of it should be put forward as insurance to be used in such circumstances.

We drove for for a while, seemingly just circling the airport for the views. This took about 30 minutes.\n5. The captain comes on saying he cant get a slot on the runway so we are returning to the gate...for the third time and people can deplane for snacks outside the gate back in the terminal. They were told that had 30 minutes and had be back on the plane. The lady next to me had a daughter who got off and she was messaging her mother saying there were not aloud back on the flight yet. This took about an hour and a half. I later over head the flight crew saying that the reason we went back was because the pilots on board for the return flight from Montego Bay had hit their limit for the day and had to be replaced. So if your following along while we boarded just before noon its now about 4:15ish.\n\n6. We roll away from the gate and get back inline for the runway. At this point the pilot comes on and says that because its late our flight would probably hit the night and one of our night running lights is out, SO we head back to the gate. This is roughly another 30 minutes down.\n\n7. Back at the gate the flight crew comes back on the plane to fix the light. This takes another hour or so.\n\nIts at this time the flight crew finally decides to hand out some snacks on the plane. Mind you they still have not giving out headphones for the entertainment system.\n\n8. Its roughly quarter to six in the afternoon, everyone on the plane is getting feisty. We finally leave the gate and get back inline for the runway. We drive and circle and run the engines up several times. We do this for a while, about an hour.\n\n9. Then we start driving and several of us on the plane note that it looks like we are driving right back to our gate. The captain comes on and says one of the passengers is having a panic attack and needs to be deplaned. A lot of yelling ensues. We wait at the gate while cops come on the plane and escort this guy off. I am not surprised he had a panic attack, we was stuck on a plane for 7 hours with no food.\n\n10. At this point the captain tells us to deplane because they have to get the luggage off the plane for the family of the panic attack guy and this could take a couple minutes. Its now roughly 7pm.\n\n11. Unbeknownst to us we are deplaning into a packed gate of very unhappy travelers to Oregon because suddenly their plane is not there, but a plane of VERY UNHAPPY passengers flooding out of the gate. Because I had been sitting at the back of the plane I was stuck in the loading tunnel for about 10 minutes while the people in the front of the plane started a screaming match with the gate people. This got people in the loading tunnel screaming about a fire hazard. Once the line got moving again I walked out to a gate that was packed to the gills with two unhappy groups of travelers and a quickly building police presence. By the end of it there were probably about 20 officers spread out around the gate with 7 or 8 keeping people away from the gate.\n\n12. Its about 7:30 now and no one knows whats going on. The cops dont know, the assorted JetBlue employees around the near gates have no idea. I go to the information booth at the center of the terminal. The lady there thought my flight had already landed in Montego Bay, funny that. She makes a bunch of calls and says that several more flight crew members hit their working limit for the day and we are waiting for new crew members, should be in on a flight around 8:15. I asked for a food voucher as I had been sitting hungry on a plane all day. She made some more calls and said snack boxes would be given out at the gate.\n\n13. Around 9:30 a new captain comes on the loud speak at the gate and says we are waiting for a few more crew members but the plane is in good working order and he expects to board soon.\n\n14. Around 10:30 we start boarding again. The same whole process as in the morning. This takes about 45 minutes.\n\n15. At 11:15-20 the captain comes back on and says that several people have decided not to continue trying to leave NY and we need to get all their bags out from the under carriage.\n\nWe finally take off around 12 midnight. Its worth noting their were a fair amount of children and some babies on the plane. My wife and I were giving away our snacks to the kids next to us because they were starving.\n\nToday, 7 days later as per the JetBlue bill or rights I called to get a credit for my flight, as per the rights both my wife and I are entitled to a credit of $250 each for being on the plane for over 6 hours.\nThe first lady I spoke to said sorry it was weather related, no credit, so I went in detail through all the events listed above and she said nope, still weather. I asked for a supervisor.\nThe supervisor came on and said its weather, so again I went through the events of the flight and she said there was a small mechanical issue that took ten minutes, otherwise its weather. She said she would be nice and give me a $50 voucher which I really didn't deserve because of weather. I told her that is ridiculous!\n\nI can fairly say I very well may never use this airline again."}, {"username": "bartnlammie", "source": "tripadvisor", "date": "Sep2019", "sentiment_score": 0.10000000149011612, "sentiment_magnitude": 1.7000000476837158, "keywords": ["flight", "leg", "routes", "passengers", "Chicago"], "location": ["Chicago ", " New York City", "Chicago"], "employees": [], "content": "First flight on JetBlue, and with a broken leg!

Let me start by saying, my flight was scheduled to leave JFK on Aug. 24th at 7:04am, the flight was delayed three times, I had to wait in the airport for more than three hours before boarding with my two children. They provided us with chips and a small drink, what a slap on the face! They did not explain why they had to delay the flight 3 times, no explanation at all, so unprofessional! Of course my two children were very tired from the wait, eat breakfast around 9:30am, so I had to buy them breakfast in the airport, and we all know how expensive they are. I don\u2019t care spending the money for my children but I think that jet blue should had provided a voucher since this was they\u2019re doing, not ours, nope, instead they provide a small bag of CHIPS & a small Drink, what a disgrace! So fine! We dealt with it. Now, leaving back from NC to NYC at 8pm, flight was delayed twice, now I\u2019m really frustrated! The final update was that flight was to leave at 9:15 pm. I went to check in my bag at 7:15 pm, the lady in the counter said, \u201cwe\u2019re already closed, we\u2019re not checking in anymore bags for that flight\u201d, I\u2019m usually a very calm person, but the attitude and the behavior this lady had towards me was unacceptable, especially when I\u2019m not at fault. Then she proceeded to say that the flight was leaving now at its original time, this company has no consideration/ethic/class, I\u2019m guessing that management has changed, please do not travel through this airline, they will make your life a living hell!\n\nThat\u2019s not all! I asked her if I could leave my bag there and have my daughter pick it up since she was outside and I didn\u2019t wish to miss my flight, after all the effort of making me more upset and making me waste time she agreed. I got at the terminal by 8:45pm, the way plain was still there, they didn\u2019t let me board the plain, no final announcements were made as other airlines do, nothing! I asked to speak to manager, the manager was right in front of me but the clerk said, he\u2019s not here right now. I continued to ask for manager, I had no clue the person next to the clerk was the manager since he had told me he wasn\u2019t there. When the manager noticed I was not leaving till I spoke to manager he stepped forward and said \u201clm the manager, how can I help you\u201d? Who knows he was probably a crew member making believe he was the manager, had no ID, I asked his name he said Roberto, refused to give me his last name nor show his ID, while this is all going on, plain was still there. \u201cManager\u201d was no help at all! He said he will reimburse me so I can take another flight, I replied is a holiday weekend, flights are extremely expensive, will JetBlue match the difference, he said, \u201cwe don\u2019t do that\u201d. He wouldn\u2019t let me get in the plain, wouldn\u2019t send me on the next flight going out, no accommodations whatsoever! It was useless speaking to the \u201cManager\u201d. The only thing they offered was to put me in a flight today at 4pm that arrives to Boston at 6pm, wait for connecting flight that leaves at 10pm, No other options were given, is either what they say or you just can walk away is the attitude I got from management. Now, I\u2019m stuck in NC, did not offer any vouchers, hotel, transportation, nothing at all!

Upon arriving to the airport we find out that the Chase booking agent erroneously and nonsensically switched the departure date to September 30th instead of August 30th. So now we are left without flights, Florida is in a state of emergency and with everyone trying to get out we are told that we could possibly be Stuck up to a week - depending on how the storm affects travel. We try every other airline in the Tampa International Airport, including flying out to all airports in and near NY. No luck.

I appreciate the planes, the service, the amount of legroom provided on even the basic seats, and I like the one class of service and the in-flight entertainment.\n\nI have always hoped Jet Blue would add a couple of healthier options to their snack offerings, such as a Kind or protein bar or an unsalted trail mix. I am still waiting, but clearly, this is not a huge deal. I can bring my own snacks. I am disappointed that they recently removed the small \"pod\" sized bottles of water from the beverage choices and replaced it with a cup of bottled water. I liked the ability to replace the cap, hence enabling me to drink it at my leisure during the flight.\n\nThe most attractive part of the Jet Blue experience is individual TVs with in-flight television, movies, and music. This system failed me on both legs of my last trip on the airline just last week. On the outbound flight, my TV was very static-filled and virtually impossible to view. Fortunately, the seat next to me was unoccupied so I watched from one seat over. It was not the most comfortable viewing situation, but it was better than nothing. I did not want to physically change seats as the person in the seat over from that one would not have been pleased losing the seat between us; neither would I have appreciated losing the extra space. On the return, my TV was stuck on one channel, the Jet Blue channel, so I had no ability to watch at all.\n\nI notified Jet Blue after the flights about my experience and the \"remedy\" was to put $15 for each of the two legs of transit in my Jet Blue bank. So now I have a whopping $30 of Jet Blue money. How that helps exactly, I am unsure. There really is no way for them to make it right, but an impersonal form email letter telling me the resolution surely was not the answer. At least an assurance that the TVs would be serviced, would have been welcomed. I would have given a 5-star customer service rating if not for this \"solution\" to the above TV issue.\n\nAs usual, the majority of the flight staff were pleasant and the flight was on-time and we arrived at our destinations safely, which is most important, of course.

I never received an email telling me my flight was cancelled and NOWHERE on the app did it tell me it was cancelled until I had to dig for more information.\n\nAfter this I called JetBlue to understand how this happened since I did NOT make any changes to this booking and just wanted to see how this happened and re-book my travel. I called and spoke with Tiffany, and she told me she had no idea how this happened. And then went back and forth with her supervisor Michelle to see if they knew why my reservation was magically cancelled. After about 5 minutes on hold i was told that someone must have logged into my account and cancelled it. Which I did not believe because I never cancelled this flight.\n\nI was then told my Tiffany that they would be willing to re-book my flight at the original cost, which sounded okay at first. But I asked how this happened in the first place and what would have happened if I didn't call in today. They told me it was essentially not their fault at all and that I was essentially to blame. I asked if they could give me any sort of upgrade or make this up to me in any way, which Tiffany told me her supervisor would not allow. I asked to speak to her supervisor then.\n\nI spoke to Michelle, who took zero accountability for what had happened. I know she did not cancel my booking, but something happened and it was cancelled and she was unwilling to work with me at all. She was extremely rude to me and kept asking for my credit card number, and I refused to give it to her until I had some sort of apology, which she refused to do.\n\nI then told Michelle that I have flown over 100 flights in the past few years for work and have never received this type of treatment from any airline employee. She did not care. I then said that I have the option to fly with other airlines, and that I would never fly with JetBlue again. Once again, she did not care about that and told me she could do it at the same rate. I then finally advised her I would not be booking with JetBlue and will be going with a different airline. I then mentioned that I would write a review about this interaction and advise all my colleagues and peers to never fly with JetBlue.\n\nOverall, I have never been disregarded as a person like this before.

Checked in two suitcases at the exact same moment. Grandsons suitcase never made it to Boston on a DIRECT FLIGHT. They couldn't find it. They'll call us. Well, it is a 2 1/2 hour drive ONE WAY. You'll need to do better than call. We had to stop and buy a bathing suit, couple changes of clothes, summer foot wear, personal care things etc. Many phone calls and we find out it went to Bosco Bay or similar in CA. It will be in Boston in 2 days when my son arrives. Oh good. My sons stuff was packed in there too as he was coming right from a job. NOT! 3 hours of searching for it and nada. It supposedly went to MEXICO and came back to Boston via United and was in United's baggage claim. Nope. So, now my son has no clothing except what's on his back. Another stop to buy stuff for him to wear. More phone calls. Lots of BS and run around by the people on the phone. Finally, 6 DAYS LATER we get a call \"Come get your bag we have it\". WHAT!!! No way you get it to us. Ok, now we are in the hands of a delivery company that has a 1 star rating and does not care AT ALL about their service. They say they will delivery the bag between...3 am and 7 am on a Sunday. WHAT!!! Never have I heard of anything like that. We are on an island so we had to sit in a car in the parking lot waiting for the bag to be delivered. It did not come. They ended up getting a tracking number and found out the bag never even left Boston until after 9 am. It finally arrived at 1 pm! The delivery phone person was the rudest, non professional person we have ever dealt with. The suitcase was intact is the only good message of this saga. Moral of the story. Jet Blue looses baggage often and on direct flights. Jet Blue does not find the lost luggage quickly and does not keep track of it once found. Jet Blue does not hire reliable delivery companies to return the luggage that you paid for and they lost. As far as the flight was concerned. It was an over nighter and they had no complaints.

On top of that we had to go through customs all over again because they took us to a hotel until the next morning for the next available flight. Therefore, we had to go through the check in process over again. To say the least, this was a terrible experience. I am a frequent flyer and have never experience treatment like this. The flight was delayed the next morning. They could not give us a reason as to why the flight kept getting delayed. When we got to FT. Lauderdale, Florida, our flight was delayed there too. We made it to Atlanta at 1:15 Tuesday morning. I see being delayed a few hours but a day and some. And when was asked how we would be compensated, we were told $150 credit towards your next flight.

The flight was scheduled to leave at 8:36 PM and arrive at JFK at roughly 11:36 PM. It was supposed to be a simple flight that I had made many times before. The morning of the flight, I checked the flight status and it said it was delayed to depart FLL at 11:10 PM and arrive at JFK at 2:07 AM. This was a big problem because I had a connecting international flight from another airline that was scheduled to leave JFK on-time at 2:30 AM. I was shocked and Jetblue website did not explain why it was delayed. I figured I would go to the airport early so I could get on another flight to NYC. After I arrived and waited in line for customer service, I talked to a Jetblue representative about the situation. He said he could get me and my family on another flight leaving to JFK at 8:30 PM that was delayed from 2:00 PM that afternoon. He claimed there were seats on it. However, he began to go on his phone for 20 minutes. Then, he seemed to make a call but never actually said a word. This continued for nearly 50 minutes because he finally broke the news to us that this flight was completely sold out and the next available flight was next morning. I don\u2019t know when this flight was sold out or if it was sold out when he told us there were seats on it. I don\u2019t know what he was doing on his phone for over an hour but I was frustrated as I could\u2019ve gone to another airline to but another ticket. However, it was too late and all flights to JFK that would have allowed me to catch my connecting flight were gone because I had wasted my time with Jetblue customer service which ended up doing nothing for me. I asked the representative why flights were being delayed and he said there were thunderstorms in NYC. I checked the departure screens afterwards and it seemed that only Jetblue flights were delayed. No other airlines were delayed. I also called my family in NYC and they said there was no inclement weather the entire day. I started to question Jetblue\u2019s honesty and transparency. With no other choice, I had to go along with my original flight and figure out the situation when I arrived to JFK. At around 11 PM, the gate agent for Jetblue announced that the flight was going to be delayed for 30 more minutes because of weather. After 20 more minutes, he announced that the flight was going to be delayed until 12 AM because there was no pilot for the plane. Everyone waiting was frustrated. Finally, at a little over midnight, we were allowed to board the plane. Before taxing out, the pilot actually walked out to the aisle and said to us that he didn\u2019t even know he was supposed to be working and that he was at home watching TV when he got a call. Does Jetblue not organize or plan which flights have pilots? Or do they just get a random pilot last minute before the flight was going to leave? I was shocked at his announcement. When we finally go to JFK at 2:45 AM, my connecting flight had already left. I talked to the customer service of that airline and they said they were able to rebook me on a different flight that left that afternoon if I was able to obtain confirmation of the delayed flight from Jetblue so it was determined it was something out of my control. So I waited at the customer service for Jetblue at JFK for them to open and was able to talk to another representative. I explained the situation and she said that she was unable to give me any confirmation of any sort of how my flight to JFK from FLL was delayed. I explained to her that it was requested from a different airline and she outright said they were lying because that is a ridiculous thing to ask. I was lost at words because it seemed as if the staff only chooses what to believe if it was convenient for them. Moments later, an employee who I assumed was the supervisor came out and told me to vacate the premises because I was causing a disruption. I never raised my voice and was being polite the entire time! He claimed I was making things up and there was nothing else he could do for me. I had to go back to the other airline and tell them what had happened. Their customer service ended up calling the Jetblue customer service and regarding the delayed flight. However, they were able to sort it out and get me on the next flight out of JFK to my next destination. The amount of unprofessionalism, dishonesty, disregard for customers, and downright rudeness I have experienced from Jetblue in less than 12 hours was insane. There is absolutely no transparency or accountability towards customers from this organization.

Almost everyone was settled in their seats when we were directed to deplane bc there was no pilot! For the next 4 hours, the flight continued to be delayed while we received updates that they were still in search of a pilot (ridiculous!). The flight was finally cancelled around 2am! At that time we were informed that we all (a full flight) needed to go to customer service to be re-booked. Customer service was understaffed (2 people for a line of about 100), so I called the 1-800 # while in line and was able to get my family booked on the next flight. However, while in line, we were informed that there would be no hotel or food vouchers given for the inconvenience, so my family (including a newborn) \"slept\" at JFK that night. The next flight was delayed also and all of these delays caused us to miss our connecting flight in Trinidad with Caribbean Airlines, so once we arrived there, we were placed on standby and didn't get to our final destination of Tobago until 2am Friday morning.

I understand this to a point but when they told us this on Thursday when we missed our connecting and that we couldn\u2019t get on a flight until Saturday at 8:40pm it makes you a little angry. Yes I was on vacation but the reason we decided to come home when we did was so we could go back to work, what you normally do when you come back from spending all your money.

They also wouldn\u2019t pay for our hotel stay because \u201cthe original reason for missing your flight was because of weather\u201d, the weather happened on Wednesday we flew on Thursday. The only reason they get two stars is because the lady we dealt was nice and \u201ctried\u201d her best, not sure she really tried. The next morning we decided to fly standby and when I asked the gate agent some questions her responses were straight rude. I am in the customer service agency and if I was rude like that to anyone I wouldn\u2019t have a job.

The level of either incompetence or of deception was extraordinary even in these days where poor performance is expected. It was as if the airline did not want us to cancel and switch to another airline irrespective of the inconvenience to the passenger. Everyone involved in this clear deception did so with a pleasant smile on their face which leads me to conclude the reason for the delay was incompetence rather than deception.\nWe finally decide to pay for a very expensive last minute ticket to an alternate airport that was closer to our destination. Now catch this. Even though a $250 payment was promised per the passenger bill of rights, since we were delayed over 8 hours, if you cancelled your reservation even at the last minute to get on an alternate flight you would lose the payment. So we got a new ticket but did not cancel the old ticket since the payment would exceed the ticket cost.\nWe have had several severe delays on JetBlue recently. The latest 8 hours to fix a sensor was the last straw. Clearly this is a severe management problem.

I called JetBlue and was on hold for over 30 minutes of asking why the flight was cancelled (no response given), and how we were to get our money back, along with a $200 change fee we were charged to book the flight in the first place. The representative became frustrated and hung up on me. I called back (now an hour later) and had to wait on hold again for 30 more minutes. When I got a hold of the next representative, she informed me that all she could do was give me a voucher. I asked to speak with a supervisor, and he told me to email all this information to this email. At this point, it was close to 10:45 PM, and we had no choice but to book a new flight. Flights to Grand Cayman were now (hours before day of departure) over $1000/person (we paid $118/person originally).

JetBlue seems to have only one permanent gate at ORD, and when JetBlue has more than one flight scheduled, they share gates with other airlines (in my case, Alaska). I reached the gate about 40 minutes before departure, and no one was at the gate. Signs in Terminal G show only American Airlines flights (?), so I could only see my gate number on the JetBlue app or through TripIt, which is when I found it had move from G2 to G4 (an Alaska gate). No one was staffing the gate, and it was barely lit, but at some point I heard a faint voice advising the flight would be delayed. About 30 minutes later another crew member said there was no update. Another 30 minutes passed, and boarding finally commenced. All the while JetBlue never updated flights stats on their website, which showed an anticipated EARLY arrival, even though it was boarding a full hour later than its departure time. Almost an hour later the doors finally closed, with little communication from the crew. Finally an explanation was provided: the AC wasn\u2019t working, but they couldn\u2019t figure out what was wrong. And after a remedy was found they had to refuel.\n\nOh, it gets worse.

The PA system isn\u2019t working, the TV screens keep scrolling promotions for upgrading to better seating (like a 1960s rabbit eared TV). The pilot decided to power down the engine and wait on the tarmac, and immediately it\u2019s clear the AC was not going to keep up. People are panting, fanning themselves, and I hear the flight attendant telling the captain there\u2019s a problem in the cabin, and based on the response the captain isn\u2019t prepared to do anything about it.\n\nWe sit there for about 30 minutes, and eventually head back to the gate, which takes another 20 minutes. They ask us all to deplane and await further instructions, which don\u2019t come for another 15 minutes. The flight is canceled, and we will be rebooked automatically, and we should wait until we receive email notifications.\n\nI asked about hotel accommodations, and the clueless gate agent said there would be none. His job, he said, was to staff the door. He didn\u2019t have any other information.\n\nI went out to ticketing and pled my case. I said it may have been delayed by weather, technically, but the ground hold would not have happened if the mechanical had been managed more efficiently. A supervisor came out and said he understood my point of view and would do what he could, but he couldn\u2019t make any promises. An hour later he said they were still trying to book a Springfield Suites. An hour. He literally said, \u201cI can\u2019t do this for everyone.\u201d Seriously. When doing the right thing is something that\u2019s available only to the most vocal, you know you have a serious systemic problem. I gave up and made my own hotel reservation. He advised I should save receipts and work with customer care, but again, \u201cno promises.\u201d\n\nAt any point any JetBlue staff could have taken an advocate\u2019s approach to the situation. There was no empathy, no problem-solving, no sense of any responsibility, no need for more than the minimum communication (which is emblematic of JetBlue). Everyone seemed to be relying on someone else to figure out the problem, and no one one took any initiative to make it better. It was a loop of pass the buck and \u201cit\u2019s not my job.\u201d\n\nOther less savvy travelers let the JetBlue system determine their fates, and I heard at least two people say they were protected on flights TWO DAYS LATER. JetBlue does not participate in interline carrier agreements and would not protect anyone on any other airlines. On one level I understand, but on another it\u2019s just reprehensible.\n\nI\u2019ve had many good flights on JetBlue, but they clearly have no internal training on how to deal with terrible situations like this one. The ticket agents didn\u2019t even know the flight had been canceled (nothing had been updated in their systems). How messed up is that? They were told to tell everyone in line that they couldn\u2019t assist them, and I could see these very decent people were completely perplexed by the morass of JetBlue."}, {"username": "ColetteS", "source": "tripadvisor", "date": "Aug2019", "sentiment_score": -0.20000000298023224, "sentiment_magnitude": 8.399999618530273, "keywords": ["airport", "Westchester County", "flights", "possibility", "staff", "number", "some", "legroom seat", "customers", "Souburbia", "line", "Florida", "flight", "flights", "line", "imaginary line", "tip", "line", "flight", "lines", "line", "weather", "anyone", "case", "events", "iceberg", "managers", "wisdom", "hotels", "people", "people", "people", "seat", "one", "flights", "window seat", "shuttle", "agents", "customer service agent", "voucher", "flight", "food"], "location": ["New York City ", " Fort Myers", "airport", "Westchester County", "Florida", "hotels"], "employees": ["Souburbia"], "content": "I have used JetBlue in the past, but today I was shocked, August 7th, 2019.

The line for cancelled flights was horrendous, but that was only the tip of the iceberg.\nOne of the JetBlue managers, in his infinite wisdom, decided to break up one of the lines and yelled that \"you can either wait in line with 400 people or 200 people\" meaning the line I was in would be at the back end of the 200 people. He didn't even tell customers where this other imaginary line was. Meanwhile, other agents were trying to discourage customers to stay in line because they didn't want to give any vouchers for hotels or food.\nJetBlue transferred me to a flight out of Westchester County airport for the following day without even asking if it was acceptable as I was in JFK. Plus, they stuck me in a middle seat and I can't even it change it online without their charging $50 for an extra legroom seat which isn't what I wanted. I just wanted an aisle or window seat.\n\nWhen I approached a JetBlue customer service agent about the possibility of getting a voucher for the shuttle I needed to get to Westchester County and a hotel, she promptly walked away.\nOne of the transport people, while probably not a JetBlue employee, told me to take the AirTrain to Westchester County. Seriously? Souburbia argued with me stating \"Mama, you asked me about flights,\" which I did not!

Before we left Cuba, our flight was delayed 3 hours. Once we got to Ft. Lauderdale, they changed our flight time 3 different times, then eventually cancelling the flight all together with no reasoning of why. We went to the JetBlue service counter to see what was going on. The woman working there looked at my husband who is a Cuban, scoffed at us and went on to tell us with a DISGUSTING attitude that our flight is cancelled and we can't get on another flight until July 27th. TWO DAYS LATER. I asked why and she said because that is all they will offer us. I asked here what she expects us to do until then and she said \"you will figure it out\" I asked to talk with her superior, who gave us the same response, then the superior above her came out and said they can fly us to New York the next day and then to Charleston. Not one time did they offer to put us in a hotel until they found us another flight. They actully refused to help us out at all. And they refused to give us any money back for the EXTREME inconvenience they caused us. LUCKILY American Airlines got us on a flight the next morning and took care of us and got my husband and I home safely. NOT JETBLUE. I will NEVERRRRR fly JetBlue again and I will do everything I can to spread the word of how horrible this airline is. They did nothing to try to make up for the inconvenience, we told them how my husband had work the next day and we MUST get home and to please help us try to figure something out, they refused. This airline is ROBBERY and RACIST.\nAfter we arrived home, a few days later a lady name Shauna from the executive offices called me to talk about the experience. I went on to tell her about how horrible the experience was, how nasty the employees treated us, and the $700.00 ticket we had to purchase from American Airlines just to get us home so my husband didn't lose his job. She said all she can say is sorry....sorry? HAHA keep your sorry Shauna how about make up for the cost and inconvenience your horrible airline caused. She said she can't do that. We asked to speak to her higher up, she said that is the CEO and he entrusts her to make al the decisions. She would not let us talk with him. So she made the DECISION to not help correct the issue. Then she got an attitude with my husband over the phone. Well Mr. CEO, if that is who you trust to make your deciions for you...BAD CHOICE BUDDY! She was just as horrible as the employees in the airport they had working for them. Maybe being a rude racist is the only people JetBlue employs!

Steer clear from jet blue.

Had our flights checked in on line the day before. We arrived with our AWAY luggage and had it checked in with no problems. We then all went through security with no problems, and went to sit at the area where our gate was. 30 minutes prior to the doors closing they called our names stating there was a problem with our luggage they had the batteries in the baggage in which we were not aware it could not be there. We purchased the away luggage because one of the biggest selling points were the chargeable batteries, this being our first flight we did not know they could not be installed in the bags where they belong. Later on one of the workers there told me they wish they would stop selling the AWAY bags as this has become a problem. Knowing that they should put up some type of signage stating if you have luggage equipped with batteries, they must be removed. They told us to hurry and sent us to a location where they stated our luggage would be there to pop out the batteries and make it back before they take off. They sent us to the wrong location stating our luggage would be there, that department sent us to the right location and our luggage was not there to remove the batteries. We waited so long for them to get the bags, moved so slow they could care less that this trip cost us $9,000 total including straight flight from Boston to Punta Cana and back, all inclusive resort for 7 days and a van to and from the resort. Finally they retrieved our bags we took the batteries out they had us place our 4 bags again at the baggage area and go to security, if they would have put us through the security quicker stating we had already been there we would have made the flight instead they stated we had to wait in line. I recieved a call from the flight attendant stating they were closing the doors and we would not make the flight and if I would give permission for my 14 year old child to travel with our older family members putting them in charge of her as she was a minor. I consented as they were on the plane already and thankfully I had my family members there I trust with all my heart. They made us miss our flight, separated us from our kids who were now on the flight with our family. I paid extra money for a straight flight. They took us out of the security line went to retrieve our bags again so they would no be on that plane and had us rebook two tickets one for me and my fiance the only ones they had available were to leave at 1:30 to JFK and then after 1.5 hours to Punta cana. We retrieved the tickets again checked in our bags and went through security. The flight attendants were very nice and explained everything on the plane where things were if needed. Instead of arriving at 12 noon in Punta Cana We arrived at 6PM after customs and everything we had to go through and the drive we arrived at 8:30 PM that night. My daughters were so happy to see us and I later found out the youngest one had cried she was afraid something would happen to us. There was no urgency on there part of taking care of passengers who paid so much money for a flight, no care or compassion for what occurred. Not even an apology. I will be posting this on multiple other sites as I do not want this happening to anyone else and feel this is unfair. We all work hard for our money in order to be able to take a vacation I missed a whole day of mine because they couldn't just take an extra step to help us. I'm very disappointed in Jet Blue. We will be taking many more vacations but I do not believe Jet Blue will be getting our money any more and from what I read on the other comments it looks that way for other people also. Thank you to anyone who has read this and understands my situation. I also paid extra $ to have a straight flight it is over a month later and bot one person has reached out to me and I'm owed money as I did not get my straight flight.

Furthermore the man we talked to threatened to not allow me to fly to Bogota after calling him and their company useless and saying the word \"bulls**\" once out of anger. I can not give them a bad enough rating. Avoid this airline with everything you can, they are totally useless and ineffective at everything they do, including transporting passengers as an airline.

His wife, who sat across the aisle, with another young child did not intervene either. The flight attendant offered us ear plugs and a drink. My husband and I were not the only travelers who arrived in San Diego completely depleted from the whole experience. I said early on that we are grandparents although our grandkids are now 11 and 14 - they are on their 2nd passports (so young seasoned travelers), but when they were small, traveling from NYC to visit us in California, they never screamed across the United States, and when they were upset, their parents made concerted efforts to calm them.

We were supposed to get on a flight from Punta Cana to Puerto Rico at 3:21 pm on July 12, 2019. ON the morning of July 12 at 8:51 AM we received an email stating that the flight was delayed to 4:33 pm. This concerned us due to the fact that our connecting flight to our final destination of Fort-Lauderdale was at 6:00 pm. As a result of our concern, and as recommended by the aforementioned email, we got to the airport at 1 PM, with 3 hours to spare. When our group got to the counter to get our boarding passes and inquire about the status of the connection due to the delay ( a flight that we had already checked in for the night before AND paid checked bags) we were told that they were aware of our reservation, since we were such a large group, and that they were waiting for us to arrive to let us know that we would not be able to make the connecting flight because of the need to go through security and pick up our checked bags upon our arrival to Puerto Rico. They repeatedly stressed that flying to Puerto Rico on the delayed flight was not an option because we would not make the connection.They also told us, very matter of factly, that they had a previous flight that they were hoping to board us on (a direct flight from Punta Cana to Fort Lauderdale that departed at 2:20 PM) but they could no longer place us on that flight because the gates had closed and that had we gotten to the airport earlier, they could have placed us all on that flight. At this point, it is important to once again mention that we had arrived at the airport 3 HOURS BEFORE OUR ORIGINAL DEPARTURE TIME. We asked why they did not notify us to get to the airport earlier through email, phone or any form of communication (as they clearly had our information and knew prior to our arrival that we would not make our connection due to a delay of your airline) and were met with blank stares and remarks that that was not their responsibility. Never, were we notified either by a call, text message or email, about this earlier flight so there was no way that we could have known that was an option. Not only was the Jet Blue Staff at Punta Cana Airport COMPLETELY AWARE that there was a group of 10 passengers that was not going to make their flights, but they FAILED to inform us that we could arrive for an earlier flight and then blamed us for not being there on time for the supposed earlier flight. We were treated with complete and utter disrespect and the options given to us were outrageous, like flying to Puerto Rico and then at 9 PM flying to New York and from New York to Fort Lauderlade making our flying time double to triple the time. The (very few) options provided were not suitable for us because we had to be home to get to our jobs and responsibilities. We were told by a staff member named Arysleidis (who refused to provide her last name OR the name of her supervisor) that was very unprofessional, that our only option would be to purchase another flight with another airline and cancel our JetBlue flight and that we would be able to get our money back from our JetBlue flights. Our only option to fly out of Punta Cana on July 12 was to book all new tickets on an American Airlines flight, including 4 in business class (because it was all they had left) so we could all leave. We spent several hours dealing with poor enthusiasm and work ethic on the part of the JetBlue Punta Cana Airport Staff, to the point where we almost missed the new American Airlines flight because we were waiting for the Jet Blue Refund WE WERE PROMISED upon cancelation, only to be told that we would not be getting a refund from them because we had purchased the tickets through Bookit. We were also told that we had 24 hours to call and request the refund and when we asked what would happen if we could not make it home in 24 hours to make the call they responded that was not their problem. At 3:52 PM when we had JUST BOARDED the American Airlines Flight we got a text message saying that the flight from Puerto Rico to Fort-Lauderdale was delayed an hour and was now departing at 7:10 PM. Meaning, we could have made our original delayed flight, even after being LIED TO and told repeatedly that we would not be able to make the connection. So after being mistreated by your staff, experiencing the lack of professionalism of your company and the poor communication given to your costumers we all want back every penny of our hard earned money, NOT in the form of a voucher or airline credit but in our original form of purchase because after this experience we do not want anything to do with Jet Blue. We are not opposed to and will result in taking legal action and going public with our experience on all social media and public stations. This entire experience has been completely unacceptable and has ruined what was supposed to be a relaxing and pleasant family experience."}, {"username": "elena111633", "source": "tripadvisor", "date": "Jul2019", "sentiment_score": 0.6000000238418579, "sentiment_magnitude": 3.0999999046325684, "keywords": ["family", "vacation", "Boston", "L.A.", "gate", "announcement", "flights", "bags", "both", "plane", "luggage", "service", "drinks", "alcohol", "meals", "Snacks", "credit card", "experience", "legroom", "amount"], "location": ["Boston ", " Los Angeles", "Boston", "L.A."], "employees": [], "content": "My family of four just flew from Boston to L.A. for a vacation.

The next flight they could get them on was Tuesday, July 9th (due to the holiday weekend and cancelled flights that had to be rebooked), and then they could only get them to LA, so they were going to have to rent a car to get home to San Diego - at their own expense.

My son and his wife were lucky in that they could afford to find a hotel room at the last minute in NYC for three nights, and they could afford the cab ride back and forth, and expenses to stay in the city another 3 days. Other flyers with kids and other groups of older people who complained to JB about the costs and that all the hotel rooms were booked due to the holiday weekend were ust out of luck.

My seats were booked for 6 months for which I paid $800 and to keep a family together and then accommodate a dog, my neice and I get the Jetblue rude attitude and to solve the problem, they are going to separate us?

I am the person who actually waits for my boarding group to be called. I don't push others out of the way to get on the plane. Well, by the time my family boarded, there was no overhead space left. The RUDE flight attendant would not help at all. There were people who put their small personal items in the overhead space to avoid having anything at their feet. There were people who boarded the plane before us with WAY TOO MANY personal items. NO ONE was helping or monitoring the boarding and bag policies. I paid for an overhead and a personal item for each of my tickets, and had to check bags. When I asked a flight attendant for help, he rudely told me that helping with the carry-on baggage was \"not his job.\" Wow! Is it MY JOB?? Because I saw exactly who boarded with TWO personal items and whose tiny bags were overhead instead of stored under the seat. I have NEVER been treated so badly on a flight, not EVEN SPIRIT! Yikes.

Almost a year ago I took a flight from Fort Lauderdale to New Hampshire for work. They had booked me on JetBlue. It didn\u2019t bother me that the flight was delayed 5 1/2 hours because I was on the clock however it makes traveling very undesirable. JetBlue offered no alternative and it wasn\u2019t until I complained that this was unacceptable granted I know some circumstances are Unavoidable like weather or lack of airline personnel. By the 4th hour of our delay I called jet blue and expressed my thoughts! They granted me a credit for future use, which brings us to this trip to Costa Rica. Again delayed again I get it they can\u2019t control the weather. Upon approaching Costa Rica we were just about to land and the plane starting to ascend. That\u2019s was contributed to poor visibility so we got redirected to another airport for fuel which delayed us yet again! Finally got air bound again to SJO airport. We were supposed to arrive in SJO at 2:00pm we didn\u2019t get to our hotel till 11:30 that night ! On the way home delayed 2 hours for what reason we will never know.

I was comfortably situated in my new seat for 10-15 minutes (in an empty row in the coach section of the plane) when the flight attendant politely asked me if i had paid for that seat. I explained the situation to her and she informed me that i could not stay in that seat if i had not paid for it. She told me I would have to move to another seat in the back of the plane. By this time, there were perhaps 30 minutes (maybe less) of flight time. I moved seats. I later contacted jet blue gave the flight attendant's name and was informed that she had acted just as Jet Blue wanted her to. I do understand rules but, seriously, was that necessary.
